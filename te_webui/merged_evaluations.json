No evidence of pulmonary artery embolism. Thrombus in the left atrium at the transition to the auricle. Emphysematous and fibrotic changes in the lung parenchyma. Urgent suspicion of a tumor-atelectasis complex in the left upper lobe of the lung. Mucus present in the lower lobe bronchi on the left. Lymph Nodes: Enlarged, FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum, particularly in regions 4R and infracarinal.\nApril 15, 2023: Lung biopsy via bronchoscopy: Endobronchial tumor manifestation in the distal left main bronchus extending to the upper lobe. Acute and chronic atrophic tracheobronchitis. Collapsed bronchial system in the affected area. Biopsy taken. Diagnosed with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), molecular diagnostics: KRAS G12C mutant.\nApril 27, 2023: Ventilation: Moderate obstruction, no restriction.

Partial response as per CT chest / abdomen +PET CT:  Moderate reduction in tumor size to approximately 4.2 cm. Contralateral metastases still present, but no new lesions. Partial bronchial obstruction persists with ongoing atelectasis in the left upper lobe. Mediastinal lymph nodes remain enlarged and FDG-positive, although with reduced metabolic activity. Thrombus in the left atrium remains unchanged. Emphysematous and fibrotic changes are stable. Overall, mild response observed with no significant progression, as per RECIST stable disease.\nAugust-October: Continued chemotherapy with Cisplatin/Pemetrexed and Pembrolizumab.\nOctober 13, 2023: Follow-up CT (chest + abdomen): SD / Progressive Disease. New nodule in the right lung (1cm). Slight increase in the size of previously noted FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum. No additional metastatic lesions were detected. The patient has continued to tolerate the current treatment regimen well, with no significant adverse effects reported.\nOctober 17, 2023: Tumor board: SD. Continuation of therapy.\nOctober 25, 2023: Continuation of Cisplatin (dose reduced), Pemetrexed and Pembrolizumab.\nJanuary 12, 2024: Follow-up CT scan abdomen and chest, FDG-PET-CT: Progressive Disease with three new metastases in the right lung and additional enlarged FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Primary tumor 5.1 cm in diameter. MRI scan of the brain conducted; no evidence of metastatic disease. Incidental findings included mild age-related cerebral atrophy and scattered white matter hyperintensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.\nMarch 17, 2024: Tumorboard recommends considering clinical trial options due to limited response to standard therapies.\nApril 20, 2024: Detailed assessment of health status.

We will evaluate each exclusion criterion based on the provided patient information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Tumors harboring driver mutations that have approved targeted therapies, with the exception of KRAS G12C mutations**\n   - The patient has a KRAS G12C mutation, which is explicitly mentioned as an exception. Therefore, the patient is eligible based on this criterion.\n   - **Decision: True**\n\n2. **Prior treatment with a KRAS G12C inhibitor is excluded for patients in a subset of groups in Phase II.**\n   - There is no mention of the patient having been treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor. Therefore, we assume the patient has not received this treatment.\n   - **Decision: True**\n\n3. **Active brain metastases, including symptomatic brain metastases or known leptomeningeal disease**\n   - The MRI scan of the brain conducted on January 12, 2024, showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Therefore, the patient does not have active brain metastases.\n   - **Decision: True**\n\n4. **Clinically significant cardiac disease or risk factors at screening**\n   - The patient has a thrombus in the left atrium, which is a significant cardiac risk factor. Therefore, the patient is not eligible based on this criterion.\n   - **Decision: False**\n\n5. **Insufficient bone marrow, hepatic or renal function at screening**\n   - The patient\u2019s routine labs, including liver and renal function tests, are within normal limits.

No evidence of pulmonary artery embolism. Thrombus in the left atrium at the transition to the auricle. Emphysematous and fibrotic changes in the lung parenchyma. Urgent suspicion of a tumor-atelectasis complex in the left upper lobe of the lung. Mucus present in the lower lobe bronchi on the left. Lymph Nodes: Enlarged, FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum, particularly in regions 4R and infracarinal.\nApril 15, 2023: Lung biopsy via bronchoscopy: Endobronchial tumor manifestation in the distal left main bronchus extending to the upper lobe. Acute and chronic atrophic tracheobronchitis. Collapsed bronchial system in the affected area. Biopsy taken. Diagnosed with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), molecular diagnostics: KRAS G12C mutant.\nApril 27, 2023: Ventilation: Moderate obstruction, no restriction. Increased airway resistance and slight hyperinflation. Tiffeneau index (FEV1/FVC) at 42.34%, z-score -3.32.

Residual volume (RV): 3.67 L, z-score 2.44. RV/TLC: 62.68%, z-score -1.18.\nMay 5, 2023: Initiated on platinum-based immunochemotherapy regimen (Cisplatin, Pemetrexed, Pembrolizumab).\nAugust 10, 2023: Completed initial therapy cycle. Partial response as per CT chest / abdomen +PET CT:  Moderate reduction in tumor size to approximately 4.2 cm. Contralateral metastases still present, but no new lesions. Partial bronchial obstruction persists with ongoing atelectasis in the left upper lobe. Mediastinal lymph nodes remain enlarged and FDG-positive, although with reduced metabolic activity. Thrombus in the left atrium remains unchanged. Emphysematous and fibrotic changes are stable. Overall, mild response observed with no significant progression, as per RECIST stable disease.\nAugust-October: Continued chemotherapy with Cisplatin/Pemetrexed and Pembrolizumab.\nOctober 13, 2023: Follow-up CT (chest + abdomen): SD / Progressive Disease. New nodule in the right lung (1cm). Slight increase in the size of previously noted FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum. No additional metastatic lesions were detected. The patient has continued to tolerate the current treatment regimen well, with no significant adverse effects reported.\nOctober 17, 2023: Tumor board: SD. Continuation of therapy.\nOctober 25, 2023: Continuation of Cisplatin (dose reduced), Pemetrexed and Pembrolizumab.\nJanuary 12, 2024: Follow-up CT scan abdomen and chest, FDG-PET-CT: Progressive Disease with three new metastases in the right lung and additional enlarged FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum. MRI scan of the brain conducted; no evidence of metastatic disease. Incidental findings included mild age-related cerebral atrophy and scattered white matter hyperintensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.\nMarch 17, 2024: Tumorboard recommends considering clinical trial options due to limited response to standard therapies.\nApril 20, 2024: Detailed assessment of health status. ECOG performance status 1. All routine labs, including liver and renal function tests, within normal limits.",
