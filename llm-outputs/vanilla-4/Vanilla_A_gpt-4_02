I am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on potential treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a patient with the given characteristics. However, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and recommendations.

In this case, the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis classified as Child-Pugh B, and three HCC lesions. The treatment strategy should take into account the liver function, tumor stage, and the patient's overall health.

Potential treatment options may include:

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): TACE is a minimally invasive procedure that delivers chemotherapy directly to the tumor while blocking the blood supply to the tumor. This can help shrink the tumor and may be an option for patients with multiple tumors who are not eligible for surgical resection.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA): RFA uses high-frequency electrical currents to heat and destroy cancer cells. It might be an option for patients with a limited number of small tumors, typically less than 5 cm in diameter. However, the effectiveness of RFA could be limited in this case due to the size of the largest lesion.

Microwave ablation (MWA): MWA is another option for treating small HCC lesions. It uses microwaves to generate heat and destroy cancer cells. This technique might be considered for this patient due to the size of the lesions.

Systemic therapy: Targeted therapy drugs, such as sorafenib or lenvatinib, or immunotherapy drugs, like nivolumab or pembrolizumab, could be considered if the patient is not eligible for locoregional treatments.

Liver transplantation: In some cases, a liver transplant may be considered for patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. However, this patient's Child-Pugh B classification may limit her eligibility for a transplant.

Clinical trials: Participation in clinical trials investigating new treatments for HCC may be a possibility for this patient.

Ultimately, the most suitable treatment option depends on the patient's specific condition and should be determined in consultation with a healthcare professional. The multidisciplinary team, including hepatologists, oncologists, and surgeons, will work together to develop the best treatment plan tailored to the patient's needs.
