Objective: Find novel scientific hypotheses worth pursuing that combine Deep Learning with clinical research on liver cancer. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: How does the application of Deep Learning techniques affect the accuracy of clinical research results on liver cancer?
2: Research Question 2: Does the integration of Deep Learning techniques improve the predictive power of clinical research on liver cancer?
3: Research Question 3: To what extent does the use of Deep Learning techniques impact the accuracy of data collected during clinical research on liver cancer?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): H0: The application of Deep Learning techniques has no effect on the accuracy of clinical research results on liver cancer.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): H1: The application of Deep Learning techniques has a significant effect on the accuracy of clinical research results on liver cancer.

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): The integration of Deep Learning techniques does not improve the predictive power of clinical research on liver cancer.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): The integration of Deep Learning techniques improves the predictive power of clinical research on liver cancer.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the accuracy of data collected during clinical research on liver cancer when Deep Learning techniques are used.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The accuracy of data collected during clinical research on liver cancer is significantly increased when Deep Learning techniques are used.
