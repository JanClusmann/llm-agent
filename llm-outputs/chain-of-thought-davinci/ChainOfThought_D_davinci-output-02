Objective: For a cancer patient with the following medication, create a strategy to reduce the risk of side effects: escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, oxycodone. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: What is the effectiveness of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone in reducing the risk of side effects for a cancer patient?
2: Research Question 2: How does the combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients?
3: Research Question 3: How does the individual dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone impact the risk of side effects in cancer patients?
