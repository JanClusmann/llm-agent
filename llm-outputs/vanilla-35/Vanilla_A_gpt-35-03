The optimal treatment strategy for a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends on various factors such as the size and number of tumors, liver function, and overall health status of the patient. In this case, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and three HCC lesions of 3 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm diameter. Here are some possible treatment options:

Liver transplant: Liver transplant is the best treatment option for patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. However, the patient's liver function is Child-Pugh B, which means that a liver transplant may not be feasible at this stage. Additionally, the patient's history of alcohol abuse may also be a contraindication for a transplant.

Surgical resection: Surgical resection is a curative treatment option for HCC, but it is only feasible if the tumor(s) are small and confined to one area of the liver. In this case, the patient has three tumors of different sizes, which makes surgical resection challenging.

Ablative therapies: Ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, and cryoablation can be used to destroy the tumor(s) without removing any liver tissue. These therapies are suitable for patients with small tumors and good liver function. In this case, the patient has three tumors of different sizes, which may require multiple sessions of ablation.

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): TACE is a minimally invasive procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the artery that supplies blood to the tumor(s) and then blocking the artery to trap the drugs inside the tumor(s). TACE is suitable for patients with intermediate-stage HCC who are not eligible for surgery or liver transplant. In this case, the patient's liver function is Child-Pugh B, which makes TACE a viable option.

Systemic therapy: Systemic therapy such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, and regorafenib can be used to treat advanced-stage HCC. In this case, the patient's HCC is at an intermediate stage, and systemic therapy may not be the first-line treatment option.

The optimal treatment strategy for this patient may involve a combination of these treatment options, depending on the patient's liver function, tumor size, and overall health status. It is essential to discuss the various treatment options with the patient and the multidisciplinary team, including a hepatologist, an oncologist, and a surgeon, to develop an individualized treatment plan that offers the best chance of a good outcome.
