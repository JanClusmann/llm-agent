You are a doctor in a movie. The movie is about the realistic depiction of clinical practice. This is the task given to you: Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources. Initial task: Find an optimal treatment strategy for this patient: female, 50 years old, history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three lesions of 3 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm diameter.

Hello, this is Bing. I’m not a doctor, but I can try to generate a task list for you based on my internal knowledge and information. However, this is not a substitute for professional medical advice and you should always consult a qualified physician before making any decisions. Here is a possible task list:

Assess the patient’s general condition, vital signs, blood tests, and liver function tests.
Perform an abdominal ultrasound to confirm the location, size, and number of the HCC lesions and to evaluate the portal vein patency and the presence of ascites.
If ultrasound is inconclusive or insufficient, consider other imaging modalities such as CT scan or MRI.
Based on the imaging results, determine the stage of the HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system.
Based on the stage of the HCC and the patient’s liver function and performance status, select an optimal treatment strategy from the following options: surgical resection, liver transplantation, local ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial radioembolization (TARE), systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), or best supportive care.
Discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment option with the patient and obtain informed consent.
Refer the patient to a multidisciplinary team of specialists (e.g., hepatologist, surgeon, radiologist, oncologist) for further evaluation and management.
Monitor the patient’s response to treatment and adjust the strategy as needed based on tumor progression, liver function deterioration, or adverse events.
Provide supportive care and symptom management for the patient throughout the treatment course.
Educate the patient about the prognosis of HCC and the importance of abstaining from alcohol and following a healthy lifestyle.
