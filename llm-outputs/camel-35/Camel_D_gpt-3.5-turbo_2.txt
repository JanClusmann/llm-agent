Instruction: Determine the patient's daily caloric needs.
Input: The patient's height, weight, and activity level.

AI Assistant:

Solution: To determine the patient's daily caloric needs, we will use the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation, which takes into account the patient's height, weight, age, and activity level. For a 50-year-old female undergoing chemotherapy, we will assume a sedentary activity level. 

The equation is as follows: 

BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161

Daily Caloric Needs = BMR x 1.2 (for sedentary activity level)

Using the patient's height, weight, and age, we calculate her basal metabolic rate (BMR) to be [INSERT CALCULATION HERE]. Multiplying this by 1.2, we get her estimated daily caloric needs to be [INSERT CALCULATION HERE].
