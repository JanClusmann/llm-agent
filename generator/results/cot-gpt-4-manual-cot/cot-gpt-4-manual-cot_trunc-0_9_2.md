Summary: 
The AI model proposed a multifaceted approach to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances. The first step involves identifying the harmful substances through surveys, research, and data analysis. It then recommended understanding the exposure pathways, whether through air, water, food, or direct contact. The model suggested developing safe exposure guidelines and conducting educational campaigns to raise public awareness. The introduction of legislation and regulations to control the use of these substances was also proposed. The model called for continuous research on long-term exposure effects and new methods for exposure reduction. Regular monitoring and evaluation of the policy's effectiveness, stakeholder collaboration, emergency preparedness, and securing funding for policy implementation and research were also part of the suggested approach.
