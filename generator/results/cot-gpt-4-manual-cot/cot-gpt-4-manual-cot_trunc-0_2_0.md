Summary: 
The AI model suggested reducing tobacco consumption in a specific European country by implementing a comprehensive tobacco control program. This plan would include measures such as increasing taxes on tobacco products to deter people from smoking, implementing laws to prohibit smoking in public places, enforcing a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, and mandating graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging. The model also proposed providing cessation support for smokers wishing to quit and conducting public education campaigns. It recommended restricting the sale of tobacco products to minors and implementing plain packaging laws, both aimed at reducing the appeal of tobacco products, especially to young people.
