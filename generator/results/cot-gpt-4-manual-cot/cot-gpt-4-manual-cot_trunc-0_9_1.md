Summary: 
The AI model suggested creating measures to decrease population exposure to hazardous materials, focusing on the elements: education and awareness, regulation and legislation, monitoring and surveillance, research, collaboration, health services, emergency preparedness, and regular review. The model encouraged public education about the substances, their sources, and health effects, alongside strict regulations controlling manufacturing, disposal, and usage of said substances. Continual monitoring and surveillance were recommended for early detection of increased exposure levels. Investment in research for safer alternatives and improved detection and treatment methods was asserted. The AI also proposed further collaboration with international organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders, and the strengthening of health services to better handle health conditions caused by hazardous substance exposure. Lastly, readiness for emergencies like chemical spills was suggested, and regular review and update of the policy or strategy based on new research findings.
