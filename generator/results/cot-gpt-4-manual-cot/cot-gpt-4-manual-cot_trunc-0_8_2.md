## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggested to design a strategy that collects data through wearables like heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity levels relevant to cancer detection. It underscored the importance of maintaining data privacy and securing data storage. The model suggested collaboration with oncologists to understand useful data for early cancer detection and development of algorithms to analyze this data using AI technologies. It emphasizes the significance of testing these algorithms through clinical trials to ensure their efficacy and safety. If successful, the AI model suggested these algorithms should be implemented in collaboration with wearable technology companies. Post-implementation, continuous monitoring and refinement are required, followed by educating the public and healthcare professionals on the benefits of using wearables for cancer screening.

Main Ideas: 
- Collection of pertinent data through wearables and ensuring privacy and security of data.
- Collaborating with oncologists to develop machine learning algorithms to analyze collected data.
- Extensive testing of algorithms through clinical trials and subsequent implementation in collaboration with wearable tech companies.
- Continuous monitoring of effectiveness, making necessary improvements, and educating the public about the benefits of this technology.
