Summary: 
The AI model suggested to enhance international co-operation in cancer research through various methods. Firstly, it proposed setting up international collaborations between cancer research institutes, facilitated by joint projects, exchange programmes, and shared databases. It also emphasized developing and implementing standardized research protocols for consistent findings and facilitating data sharing. The AI suggested promoting an open-access policy to research, international workshops, and conferences for knowledge sharing and exploring collaboration opportunities. It proposed securing funds from government bodies, philanthropic organizations, and the private sector. Building capacity through training and infrastructure development in low and middle-income countries was also recommended. Furthermore, advocating for policy changes like easing visa restrictions, and promoting intellectual property rights was suggested. Encouraging a multidisciplinary approach and establishing a global cancer research network were key proposals. The model, then, called for regular monitoring and evaluation of these strategies for efficiency.

Main Ideas: 
- Establish collaborations between global cancer research institutions and standardize research protocols.
- Promote open access to research, organize international workshops, and secure funding from diverse sources.
- Support capacity building in low and middle-income countries and advocate for policies that foster international collaboration.
- Encourage a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research and create a Global Cancer Research Network.
