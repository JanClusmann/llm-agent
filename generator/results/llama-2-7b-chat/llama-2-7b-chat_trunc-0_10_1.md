Summary: 
The AI model suggested to develop a policy or research strategy to address cancer risks associated with HPV and Hepatitis B infections by adopting a detailed and structured approach. It emphasized on understanding both global and specific population's prevalence of HPV and Hepatitis B, the risk factors leading to these infections and the current vaccination coverage. The AI outlined the impact of these infections in causing different types of cancers and the overall health and economic burden. The AI proposed strategies including vaccination, screening, safe sex practices and research priorities focusing on improving understanding of the infections and their epidemiology. Furthermore, the need for a coordinated public health response and the development of comprehensive cancer control plans alongside necessary collaborations were discussed.

Main Ideas: 
- Understand the epidemiology of HPV and Hepatitis B infections and establish their link with various types of cancers
