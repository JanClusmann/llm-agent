Summary: 
The AI model suggested to establish a global cancer research database to consolidate worldwide data on cancer research, launching a network of international cancer research centers focusing on different aspects of research. The model proposed promoting international collaboration in clinical trials and developing global standards for cancer research to make findings consistent globally. Interdisciplinary research was also suggested for a holistic understanding of cancer biology. The AI model emphasized early-career researcher support and addressing disparities in cancer research, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The model was of the view that translational research needs encouragement and public-private partnerships could be spurred for prompt translation of research results into clinical practice. The solution concluded by recommending a comprehensive cancer research strategy aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to address significant challenges like cancer incidence, mortality, and disparities.

Main Ideas:
