Summary: 
The AI model suggested a multi-faceted approach to reduce the populationâ€™s exposure to hazardous substances through a policy and related research strategy. Firstly, it posed the need to identify and prioritize hazardous substances based on the risk they pose to public health. It then recommended conducting studies to assess exposure levels in different populations. The model advocated for safer alternatives' development and use, enhancing waste management practices, and promoting awareness about the risks of hazardous substances. It further suggested to lobby for policy and regulatory changes, support research and development, regularly monitor and evaluate the strategy's effectiveness, and engage stakeholders. Lastly, the AI proposed that a comprehensive plan outlining steps, timelines, and required resources be developed to keep the policy relevant and effective.
