## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggests a comprehensive strategy to boost international collaboration in cancer research, encompassing the creation of a global database, establishment of standardized frameworks, promotion of interdisciplinary work, support of early-career scientists, and fostering academia-industry collaboration. It also envisages capacity-building initiatives, funding mechanisms, ethical regulations, and a system for monitoring and evaluation. The measure would help translate research findings into actual medical practice.

Main Ideas: 
- Creation of a global cancer research database and standardized research frameworks for uniformity.
- Encouragement of cross-disciplinary work, funding mechanisms, and capacity-building initiatives.
- Development of progress-monitoring systems and strategies to translate research outcomes into clinical practice.

Main Finding: 
- A comprehensive international cooperation strategy can expedite cancer research.
- The focus should be on consistent data sharing, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and research translation.
- The investment in next-generation researchers and mechanisms for monitoring progress are vital to the success of the strategy.
