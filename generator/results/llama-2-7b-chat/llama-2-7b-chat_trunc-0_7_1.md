Summary: 
The AI model suggested a coordinated and multilateral approach to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research. It proposed the creation of a global database that collects and shares cancer research data worldwide. It encouraged establishing a standardized framework for cancer research to allow comparability across various studies. The model suggested promoting interdisciplinary research, supporting early-career researchers and fostering international collaboration via funding mechanisms. It also recommended organizing workshops and conferences for knowledge sharing among researchers from different countries, dealing with ethical and regulatory issues related to data sharing, informed consent, and intellectual property. Lastly, the model highlighted the importance of collaborations between academia, industry, and government in developing new diagnostics and treatments, and emphasized translating research findings into clinical practice and monitoring progress.
