> Assistant:  As a medical advisor, I would propose the following comprehensive policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country:
1. Increase Tobacco Taxation:
	* Implement a significant increase in tobacco taxes to make cigarettes and other tobacco products more expensive. This will reduce demand and encourage smokers to quit.
	* Introduce a sliding scale of taxes based on the price of the tobacco product, with higher taxes for premium and luxury brands.
	* Consider implementing a tax on nicotine-based e-cigarettes and other vaping products.
2. Implement Smoke-Free Public Places:
	* Designate all public places, including workplaces, restaurants, bars, and sports stadiums, as smoke-free zones.
	* Provide clear signage and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.
	* Gradually increase the ban to include all outdoor public places, such as parks and beaches, to further reduce exposure to secondhand smoke.
3. Promote Cessation Services:
	* Increase funding for cessation programs, including counseling, medication, and hotlines.
	* Provide incentives for healthcare providers to encourage smokers to quit, such as free or low-cost cessation services for patients.
	* Develop a comprehensive quit plan that includes a range of cessation strategies and resources, tailored to different populations and smoking behaviors.
4. Restrict Tobacco Advertising:
	* Ban all tobacco advertising and sponsorship, including print, radio, and television ads, as well as product placement in movies and sports events.
	* Implement strict regulations on the packaging and labeling of tobacco products, including graphic health warnings and plain packaging.
	* Ban the sale of tobacco products near schools and other areas where children congregate.
5. Enhance Education and Awareness:
	* Develop and implement comprehensive tobacco education programs in schools, targeting students from elementary school through high school.
	* Provide training and resources for teachers and healthcare providers to help them address tobacco use with students and patients.
	* Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the general public about the risks of tobacco use and the benefits of quitting.
6. Improve Access to Quitline Services:
	* Provide free or low-cost quitline services, including counseling and medication, to help smokers quit.
	* Promote the use of quitline services through public awareness campaigns and healthcare provider networks.
	* Develop partnerships with employers and insurance providers to cover the cost of quitline services for their employees and policyholders.
7. Address Social Determinants of Tobacco Use:
	* Develop and implement policies to address the social determinants of tobacco use, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to healthcare.
	* Provide targeted interventions to reduce tobacco use in disadvantaged populations, such as low-income communities and indigenous populations.
8. Monitor and Evaluate Progress:
	* Establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system to track progress towards tobacco control goals.
	* Use data and surveillance to identify areas of success and areas for improvement, and adjust policies accordingly.
	* Collaborate with international organizations and other countries to share best practices and learn from their experiences.
9. Enforce Tobacco Control Policies:
	* Establish a robust enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with tobacco control policies.
	* Provide training and resources for law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders to help them enforce tobacco control policies.
	* Conduct regular inspections and compliance checks to monitor adherence to tobacco control policies.
10. Support Research and Development:
	* Establish a research fund to support innovative tobacco control research and development.
	* Encourage collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to identify new and effective tobacco control strategies.
	* Provide funding for research on the impact of tobacco control policies on public health and the economy.

By implementing these comprehensive policies, a specific European country can significantly reduce tobacco consumption and improve public health outcomes.
