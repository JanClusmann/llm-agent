> Assistant:  Title: Early Cancer Detection and Referral Training Program for Primary Care Physicians

Objective:
The objective of this training program is to enhance the knowledge and skills of primary care physicians in early cancer detection and referral, ultimately improving cancer outcomes in the community.
Target Audience:
Primary care physicians, including family medicine physicians, internal medicine physicians, and pediatricians.
Duration:
The training program will be conducted over a period of 6 months, with the following structure:

Month 1: Introduction to Cancer Detection and Referral
