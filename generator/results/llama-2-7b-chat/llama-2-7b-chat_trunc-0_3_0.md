Summary: 
The AI model suggested several improvements to a breast cancer early detection program in Europe. First, it recommended increasing awareness and education through targeted public campaigns, providing resources for healthcare providers, and encouraging patient-provider conversations about screening. Second, it suggested improving access to screening by increasing the number of centers, providing financial support for mammograms, and partnering with community organizations. Third, enhancing screening technologies like DBT and ABUS, and developing new imaging biomarkers were proposed. It recommended improving data management with a centralized screening registry, analytics to identify high-risk patients, and algorithms for predicting malignancy. It stressed on enhancing collaboration and referral pathways with guidelines, multidisciplinary conferences, and collaboration between physicians and specialists. Moreover, it emphasized the promotion of early detection through telemedicine platforms, offering virtual consultations, interdisciplinary research, and innovation. Lastly, it suggested addressing disparities in cancer outcomes, improving patient navigation, and monitoring and evaluating the program's performance.
