> Assistant:  As a medical advisor, I would propose the following comprehensive policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country:

1. Raising the minimum age of smoking: Increasing the legal age of smoking from 18 to 21 would significantly reduce the number of young people taking up smoking. This would also align with the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation to raise the minimum age of smoking to 21.
2. Increasing taxes on tobacco products: Tobacco taxes are an effective way to reduce tobacco consumption. Increasing taxes on tobacco products would make them less affordable for smokers, particularly for low-income individuals who are more likely to smoke. This would also help to reduce the black market for tobacco products.
3. Implementing plain packaging: Requiring tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging would reduce the appeal of tobacco products and make them less attractive to young people. This would also make it more difficult for tobacco companies to target young people through their packaging.
4. Banning tobacco advertising: Tobacco companies spend billions of dollars each year on advertising and promotion. Banning tobacco advertising would significantly reduce the number of people exposed to pro-tobacco messages. This would also help to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking.
5. Increasing funding for tobacco cessation programs: Providing adequate funding for tobacco cessation programs would help to support smokers who want to quit. This could include providing free or low-cost nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and other forms of support.
6. Implementing smoke-free laws: Enacting smoke-free laws in public places, such as restaurants, bars, and workplaces, would reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and encourage smokers to quit.
7. Increasing public education campaigns: Launching public education campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco use and the benefits of quitting would help to reduce tobacco consumption. These campaigns could be targeted at both young people and adults.
8. Encouraging workplace wellness programs: Encouraging workplace wellness programs that provide support for smokers who want to quit would help to reduce tobacco consumption. This could include providing free or low-cost nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and other forms of support.
9. Implementing a ban on smoking in cars with children: Smoking in cars with children is a significant source of secondhand smoke exposure for children. Implementing a ban on smoking in cars with children would help to reduce secondhand smoke exposure and encourage smokers to quit.
10. Monitoring and evaluating tobacco control policies: Regularly monitoring and evaluating tobacco control policies would help to identify areas for improvement and ensure that policies are effective in reducing tobacco consumption. This could include conducting surveys, collecting data on tobacco use, and analyzing the impact of policies on tobacco consumption.

In conclusion, implementing a comprehensive tobacco control policy that includes raising the minimum age of smoking, increasing taxes on tobacco products, plain packaging, banning tobacco advertising, increasing funding for tobacco cessation programs, smoke-free laws, public education campaigns, workplace wellness programs, and monitoring and evaluating tobacco control policies would significantly reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country. By implementing these policies, the country can reduce the burden of tobacco-related diseases and improve public health.
