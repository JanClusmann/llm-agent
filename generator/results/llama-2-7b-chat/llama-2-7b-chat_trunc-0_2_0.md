Summary: 
The AI model suggested to introduce a novel policy on reducing tobacco consumption in a European country. The major aspects of the policy proposed by the AI are raising the smoking age to 21, increasing tobacco taxes, and requiring plain packaging for tobacco products. Enhanced enforcement of advertising bans, additional funding for tobacco cessation programs, and enforcing smoke-free laws were also put forward. The AI model also highlighted the need for public educational campaigns, the promotion of workplace wellness programs, and banning smoking in cars when children are present. The policy concludes with regular monitoring and evaluation of the tobacco control policies to improve their effectiveness. 

Main ideas: 
- Raise smoking age to 21, increase taxes on tobacco products and enforce plain packaging.
- Implement smoke-free laws and ban tobacco advertising completely.
- Increase funding for tobacco cessation programs and launch extensive public educational campaigns.
