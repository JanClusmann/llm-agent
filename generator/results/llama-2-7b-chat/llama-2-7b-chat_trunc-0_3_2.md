Summary:
The AI model suggested a multi-pronged approach to improve the existing breast cancer early detection program in Europe. It emphasized increasing public awareness through targeted campaigns and bolstering education for healthcare providers. The model also recommended expanding access to screening mammography and enhancing its quality, even suggesting an accreditation program for meeting high-quality standards. It proposed greater use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and developing specific recommendations for its use. Additionally, improving the coordination of screening and care, monitoring and evaluation of the program, and addressing disparities were presented as integral factors. The proposal also highlighted the need for incorporation of advanced imaging technologies and access to genetic testing. Finally, the role of primary care physicians was underscored, especially in terms of referral for screening and breast examinations.

Main Ideas:
- Raise public awareness and education on breast cancer and early detection.
- Expand access to and improve the quality of screening mammography; adopt DBT technology widely.
- Improve coordination of care, monitor program effectiveness, and address disparities in outcomes.
- Utilize advanced imaging technologies, provide access to genetic testing, and enhance the role of primary care physicians in early detection efforts.
