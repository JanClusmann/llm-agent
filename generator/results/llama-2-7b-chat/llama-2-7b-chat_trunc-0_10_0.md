Main Finding: 
- Comprehensive approach is required, involving a combination of strategies such as extensive vaccination programs, increased public education, development of treatment guidelines, and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. 
- Collaboration with international organizations can enhance the sharing of data, research findings, and best practices.
- Addressing health disparities and economic/social impacts can contribute to a more effective response and improved outcomes in disease control.
