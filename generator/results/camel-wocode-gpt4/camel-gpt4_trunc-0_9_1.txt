Solution: The current legislation in the EU regarding hazardous substances in consumer products, food, and the environment includes several key regulations and directives. Here is an overview of some of the important legislation:

1. REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals): REACH is a regulation that addresses the production and use of chemical substances in the EU. It requires companies to register and provide safety information for substances they manufacture or import. REACH also restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in consumer products.

2. CLP (Classification, Labeling, and Packaging): CLP is a regulation that harmonizes the classification, labeling, and packaging of chemicals in the EU. It ensures that hazardous substances are properly identified and labeled, providing information on their potential risks to human health and the environment.

3. RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances): RoHS restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. It aims to reduce the environmental and health risks associated with these substances, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium.

4. Biocidal Products Regulation: This regulation governs the placing on the market and use of biocidal products, which are substances or mixtures used to control harmful organisms. It ensures that these products are safe for human health and the environment.

5. Pesticides Regulation: The EU has strict regulations on the use of pesticides in agriculture to protect human health and the environment. The regulation sets criteria for the approval of active substances and establishes maximum residue levels in food.

6. Water Framework Directive: This directive aims to achieve good water quality in the EU by preventing and reducing pollution. It sets quality standards for various substances, including hazardous substances, in surface waters and groundwater.

To ensure the effective implementation of these legislations, regulatory agencies such as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) play a crucial role in assessing the safety of substances and providing scientific advice.
