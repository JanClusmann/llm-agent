Summary: 
The AI model suggested a multi-step approach for reducing exposure to hazardous substances. The first step identified involves recognizing the various hazardous substances to which the population is exposed. The model then emphasized the need for risk assessment, determining the health risks associated with these substances, the level of exposure, and the demographics most at risk. Further, the AI proposed development of safety guidelines and standards, the need for public education and awareness campaigns, as well as ongoing research and monitoring of the effectiveness of these measures. It also asserted the importance of legislation and penalties for those who do not comply with these standards. More so, it emphasized the significance of collaboration with environmental agencies, health organizations and research institutions. The framework would be regularly evaluated and reviewed to ensure its effectiveness.
