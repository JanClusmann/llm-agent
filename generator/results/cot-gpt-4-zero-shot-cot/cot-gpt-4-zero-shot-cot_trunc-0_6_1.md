Summary: 
The AI model suggested to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors by a thorough approach starting from identification of their needs through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This is followed by a comprehensive literature review to understand present research status and identify knowledge gaps. A collaboration with stakeholders such as oncologists, psychologists, social workers, and survivors would influence the policy or research strategy. The developed strategy would involve testing new interventions, tracking long-term effects of cancer, or exploring lived experiences of survivors. This should lead to the development of a policy that could advocate healthcare practice changes. Implementation of the policy would require partnerships, after which its effectiveness should be evaluated. Results would then be shared with the wider medical and scientific community, and based on this feedback, improvements would be continuously made in the strategy. Finally, advocating for the needs of cancer survivors at all levels is important.

Main Ideas:

- Develop a research strategy through a comprehensive literature review and stakeholder collaboration.
- Implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the developed policy.
- Share findings, continuously improve strategy based on feedback, and advocate for the needs of cancer survivors.
