Summary: 
The AI model suggested to initiate the reduction of exposure to hazardous substances by identifying the substances and conducting extensive research on their impact on human health, involving study of existing literature and conducting surveys. Collaborating with environmental scientists, toxicologists and other experts is critical in understanding the issue comprehensively. It advocates for carrying out a risk assessment to determine the exposure level and associated health risks, followed by developing comprehendible and implementable guidelines for safe levels of exposure. Policies should be formulated to enforce these guidelines, potentially incorporating regulations on industrial emissions and chemical use. Creating public awareness on hazardous substances, their health effects, and preventive measures is essential, through workshops, social media campaigns and other avenues. The model recommends establishing a monitoring and evaluation system to examine the levels of environmental substances and to determine the effectiveness of the policies. It also encourages constant improvements to these policies based on evaluation results, as well as collaboration with stakeholders for successful policy implementation.

Main Ideas: 
- Identify hazardous substances and conduct extensive research on their impacts on human health.
- Collaborate with experts for comprehensive understanding, assess risks and develop guidelines for safe exposure.
- Formulate policies that enforce these guidelines and educate the public about these substances and how to minimize exposure.
- Implement monitoring and evaluation systems to ensure policy effectiveness and encourage continuous policy improvements based on the evaluation.
