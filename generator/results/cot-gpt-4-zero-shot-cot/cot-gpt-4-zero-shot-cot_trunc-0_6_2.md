Summary: 
The AI model suggested to commence with need identification of cancer survivors by utilizing methods such as surveys, interviews, and focus groups to understand their physical, emotional, social, and financial requirements. Conducting a literature review to understand the current research and policies was advised to identify gaps that need to be addressed. It proposed collaborating with various stakeholders including survivors, healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers to develop a comprehensive policy or research strategy. Based on these needs and gaps, the model stressed the formulation of a research strategy including studies to understand the impact of cancer on quality of life, evaluating existing interventions, and developing new ones. The insights gained from research should be used for policy development aimed at improving survivors' quality of life through various means. Implementing the policies in phases, and continuously monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness were also emphasized. Dissemination of findings and policy advocacy were marked as important steps. The model finally highlighted the importance of continuous policy improvement based on feedback and new research findings.
