Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive policy to reduce tobacco consumption in the UK which includes eight main points. Firstly, the model proposed increasing taxes on tobacco products to make them less financially attractive, with tax revenues used for public health initiatives. Secondly, it suggested implementing plain packaging laws to make health warnings more prominent. Thirdly, it advised expanding smoke-free zones to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and decrease the social acceptability of smoking. Fourthly, it recommended launching public awareness campaigns to educate people about the dangers of smoking. Fifthly, the model highlighted the importance of supporting individuals who wish to quit smoking by providing subsidized nicotine replacement therapies, counseling, and quitline services. Sixthly, it suggested the regulation of alternative nicotine products like e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. Regular monitoring and evaluation of these measures, alongside collaboration with international health organizations, were the last two recommendations made by the AI model.
