Summary: 
The AI model suggested to establish a Global Cancer Research Network involving cancer research institutions, universities, and non-profit organizations worldwide. It proposed creating a Centralized Database with the latest cancer-related research, clinical trials, and treatment methods accessible to all members. It recommended holding regular international conferences and workshops to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration. Joint research projects would promote resource efficiency. Implementation of exchange programs for researchers and students was suggested to facilitate knowledge sharing and learning from international experts. The model advocated for standardizing research protocols across institutions, promoting open access, and advocating for policy changes supportive of cancer research. It also suggested establishing a global fund to support cancer research and a frequent evaluation process to measure the effectiveness of these strategies.
