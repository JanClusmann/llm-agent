Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive policy for reducing tobacco consumption in the United Kingdom. This policy includes eight main measures: increasing taxes on tobacco products, implementing plain packaging laws, expanding smoke-free zones, strengthening advertising restrictions, conducting mass media campaigns, improving access to cessation services, implementing regular monitoring and evaluation of these tobacco control measures, and raising education and awareness about the perils of tobacco use. The model suggested that by making tobacco products more expensive and less appealing visually, reducing exposure to secondhand smoke, and lowering the visibility of such products through advertising bans, consumption may be reduced. Mass media campaigns and cessation services aim to support people in quitting smoking. Regular review of these strategies ensures their effectiveness and allows for necessary adjustments. Lastly, educational programs for various age groups, including children, young adults, and parents, can further discourage tobacco use. 

Main Ideas: 
- Increase taxes on tobacco products and implement plain packaging laws.
- Expand smoke-free zones and tighten advertising restrictions.
- Conduct targeted mass media campaigns and improve access to cessation services.
- Regularly monitor and evaluate tobacco control measures and implement comprehensive educational programs.
