Summary: 
The AI model suggested to identify the needs of cancer survivors through surveys, interviews, and focus groups to understand their unique challenges. It proposed that a literature review should be conducted to understand the current state of research on cancer survivorship, aiming to identify knowledge gaps. In addition, it recommended collaboration with stakeholders, such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers. The model recommended the development of a research strategy based on the identified needs and literature review, along with policy development that addresses the needs of the patients. The policy or research strategy should then be implemented, and its effectiveness should be regularly evaluated. The model also highlighted the importance of disseminating the research findings among stakeholders and adjusting the strategy based on the evaluation results. Lastly, it mentioned securing funding as a crucial step to support the research or policy implementation.
