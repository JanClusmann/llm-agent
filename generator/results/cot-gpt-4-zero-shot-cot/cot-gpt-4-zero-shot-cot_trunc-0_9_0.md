Summary: 
The AI model suggested a step-by-step approach for reducing population exposure to hazardous substances. It recommended first identifying these substances, which may include chemicals, pollutants, and radiation. On identification, a risk assessment should be conducted to determine factors like exposure level, potential health effects, and at-risk populations. Once the assessment is completed, guidelines and standards should be created to limit exposure, and control measures like ventilation systems, training programs, and protective equipment should be deployed. Public education and awareness campaigns are crucial and should be accompanied by monitoring and evaluation of the policy's effectiveness. Further research and development to keep up with emerging hazardous substances is encouraged, as well as regular policy reviews and updates based on changes in exposure levels and new findings. Finally, collaboration and partnerships should be forged to ensure successful implementation, supported by a robust legal and regulatory framework for enforcement purposes.

Main Ideas: 
- Identify hazardous substances and conduct risk assessment to determine exposure level, potential health effects, and target populations.
- Develop exposure-limiting guidelines and standards, implement control measures, and run public education campaigns.
- Regularly monitor and evaluate effectiveness of the implemented strategy, conduct ongoing research and development, and continuously review and update policies.
- Foster collaboration and partnerships for implementation, backed by a strong legal and regulatory framework for enforcement.
