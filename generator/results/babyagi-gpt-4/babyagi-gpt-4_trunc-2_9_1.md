Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to decrease the exposure to hazardous substances. This method includes conducting a risk assessment, identifying the hazards associated with different substances, quantifying the exposure, and proposing risk reduction measures. Moreover, the AI suggested regular updates of the risk assessment and open communication with relevant stakeholders. In addition to this, determining potential health impacts of hazards, establishing a ranking system, and developing effective risk mitigation strategies were recommended. Furthermore, the model proposed an in-depth framework for identifying and managing key stakeholders. Approaches included understanding stakeholders' needs and expectations, establishing a method for stakeholder consultation, and developing a stakeholder communication plan, followed by regular updates to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.
