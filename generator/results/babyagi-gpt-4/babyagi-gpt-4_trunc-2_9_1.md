Summary: 
The AI model proposes a comprehensive approach to reduce exposure to hazardous substances by conducting a Risk Assessment and identifying Key Stakeholders involved. The risk assessment process comprises of defining objectives, identifying hazards, determining exposure, evaluating risk, identifying risk reduction measures, and documenting and communicating the findings. The stakeholder identification process involves reviewing projects, identifying internal and external stakeholders, prioritizing them, understanding their needs, documenting their information, developing a communication plan, and regularly reviewing the stakeholder list.

Main Ideas: 
- Conduct a thorough Risk Assessment to identify, evaluate and mitigate the different types of risks related to exposure to hazardous substances.
- Identify Key Stakeholders, understand their interests and needs, and develop a communication strategy for effective engagement.
- Develop a systematic plan for implementing, tracking, evaluating, and updating risk mitigation strategies, as well as stakeholder engagement strategies.

Main Finding: 
- A comprehensive risk assessment can shed light on how and to what extent different population groups are exposed to hazardous substances and what measures can be taken to mitigate these risks.
- Stakeholder identification and engagement is integral to the policy or research strategy to ensure that their concerns are addressed and the devised strategy is more effective and widely accepted.
- Regular review and update of risk assessment and stakeholder engagement strategies are essential to maintain their relevance and effectiveness.
