Summary: 
The AI model suggested to conduct a SWOT analysis on the current state of international cooperation in cancer research, involving the collection of all relevant information and identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Based on the SWOT analysis, it recommended the development of strategies for improvement, which should be encapsulated in a comprehensive report. The model then proposed 20 tasks to facilitate effective international cooperation for cancer research. These tasks range from developing a research collaboration platform and a research innovation fund, to establishing a research funding board and a research policy review board. Furthermore, the system suggested performing a gap analysis on the current state of international cooperation in cancer research while developing data tracking, feedback mechanism, and plan of action to bridge these gaps.

Main Ideas: 
- Conducting a SWOT analysis to get insights into the current state of international cooperation in cancer research.
- Suggesting the establishment of different systems, platforms, and programs that can address identified weaknesses and threats, and leverage strengths and opportunities in cancer research. 
- Proposing measures to ensure regular review and impact assessment of the established systems and platforms.
- Identifying gaps in the current state and developing a plan of action for improvement, which is to be constantly reviewed, refined, and monitored for efficacy.
