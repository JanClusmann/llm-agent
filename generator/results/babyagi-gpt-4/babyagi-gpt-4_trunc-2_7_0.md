Summary: 
The AI model suggested a phased approach to establish international cooperation in cancer research policy. In phase one, existing policies and documents would be gathered and thoroughly analyzed to determine their strengths and weaknesses in terms of their objectives, strategies, inclusivity, clarity, and adaptability. The strengths and weaknesses of these policies would then be documented and categorized. Following the analysis, a comprehensive report would be prepared detailing these findings. In the second phase, the evaluation would form the basis for the development of a new policy, with steps including identifying key areas of focus, potential stakeholders, and obtaining their input about the new policy. The draft policy would be presented to relevant authorities for approval. The implementation of the policy would involve promotion, managing potential challenges, continuous revision, training, stakeholder recognition, potential collaborations, monitoring, evaluation, regular reporting, and ensuring the policy's continuous improvement. Lastly, in identifying gaps in existing policies, the AI proposes a continuous assessment of policy relevance, legal, ethical, and technological implications, budgetary concerns, impact on patient outcomes, consistency with other policies, and strategies to address all these areas.

Main Ideas: 
- Thorough evaluation of existing international cancer research policies to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
- Designing a new policy that addresses identified gaps and incorporates strength areas of existing policies, backed by stakeholder engagement.
- Strategic plan for implementing, promoting, and managing potential challenges of the new policy.
- Constant policy assessment, addressing legal, ethical, and technological implications, budgetary concerns, and patient outcomes.
