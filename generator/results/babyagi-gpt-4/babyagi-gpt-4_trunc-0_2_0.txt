*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the specific European country with high tobacco consumption rates

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Start by defining what constitutes high tobacco consumption rates. This could be based on the percentage of the population that smokes, the number of cigarettes smoked per person per year, or another similar metric.

2. Begin your research by looking at your own knowledge and understanding of the topic. Do you already know of any European countries with high tobacco consumption rates? If so, list them down.

3. Use your creativity to think about why certain countries might have higher tobacco consumption rates. This could be due to cultural factors, economic factors, or other reasons. 

4. Use this understanding to create a list of potential countries that might have high tobacco consumption rates. 

5. Now, start to narrow down your list. Use your problem-solving skills to think about which countries are most likely to have high tobacco consumption rates. 

6. Once you have a shortlist, start to look for more specific information. Do you have any books, reports, or other resources that might contain this information? If so, start to look through these.

7. As you find relevant information, make a note of it. This could be statistics on tobacco consumption, information on smoking laws and regulations, or other relevant details.

8. Once you have gathered all your information, start to analyze it. Which country has the highest tobacco consumption rates according to your research?

9. If you have multiple countries with similar rates, use your creativity and problem-solving skills to decide which one is the most significant. This could be based on the size of the population, the impact of smoking on public health, or other factors.

10. Once you have identified the specific European country with high tobacco consumption rates, make a note of it. 

11. Finally, review your process. Did you use introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies effectively? If not, think about how you could improve for next time.
