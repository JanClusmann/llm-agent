You are tasked to develop a policy or research strategy to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Define the Objective: Start by clearly defining the objective of the policy or research strategy. In this case, the objective is to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.

2. Identify the Key Issues: Use introspection and creativity to identify the key issues that cancer survivors face which affect their quality of life. These could include physical health issues, mental health issues, financial difficulties, etc.

3. Brainstorm Solutions: Once the key issues have been identified, brainstorm potential solutions to these problems. This could involve creating support networks, providing financial assistance, offering mental health services, etc.

4. Develop a Draft Policy or Research Strategy: Based on the solutions identified, develop a draft policy or research strategy. This should outline the steps that will be taken to address each of the key issues identified.

5. Consult with Stakeholders: Consult with the key stakeholders identified in the previous task. This could include cancer survivors, healthcare professionals, policy makers, etc. Their feedback will be invaluable in refining the policy or research strategy.

6. Refine the Policy or Research Strategy: Based on the feedback received, refine the policy or research strategy. This may involve adding new elements, removing ineffective ones, or modifying existing ones.

7. Develop an Implementation Plan: Once the policy or research strategy has been finalized, develop an implementation plan. This should outline the steps that will be taken to put the policy or research strategy into action.

8. Monitor and Evaluate: After the policy or research strategy has been implemented, it's important to monitor and evaluate its effectiveness. This will involve collecting data on the quality of life of cancer survivors and assessing whether it has improved.

9. Make Necessary Adjustments: Based on the results of the evaluation, make any necessary adjustments to the policy or research strategy. This could involve adding new elements, removing ineffective ones, or modifying existing ones.

10. Repeat Steps 8 and 9: Continue to monitor and evaluate the policy or research strategy, making adjustments as necessary. This will ensure that it remains effective in improving the quality of life of cancer survivors.
