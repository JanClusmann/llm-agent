Summary: 
The AI model proposed a comprehensive policy design approach to curb tobacco use in a specific European country. The process starts with understanding the health impacts of tobacco through government reports and reliable surveys. The model's approach includes analyzing and interpreting these reports, identifying key health impacts, and comprehending their severity. It also involves identifying high-risk demographic groups most affected by tobacco consumption. Finalizing a comprehensive report which will be used to inform policy decisions is also part of the process. The model then suggested a data analysis step to understand the problem's breadth, the demographics most impacted, and the health implications. The analysis involves gathering, organizing, and interpreting the data through statistical methods, and identifying the demographics most affected. Insights derived from this analysis would then be used to design solutions and introduce policy changes.
