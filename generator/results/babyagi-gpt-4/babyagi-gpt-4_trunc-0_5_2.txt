4. Identify the Trainers: Find experienced oncologists, cancer researchers, and medical educators who can deliver the training. They should have a deep understanding of the subject matter and the ability to teach effectively.

5. Secure Funding: Use the identified potential funding sources to finance the training program. This could involve applying for grants, seeking sponsorships, or using internal resources.

6. Plan the Logistics: Decide on the venue, date, and time for the training. Also, plan for the necessary materials and equipment, such as projectors, handouts, and medical models.

7. Promote the Program: Inform primary care physicians about the training program. This could be done through emails, newsletters, or professional networks. Also, highlight the benefits of the training to encourage participation.

8. Conduct the Training: Implement the training program as planned. Ensure that the trainers deliver the content effectively and that the participants are engaged.

9. Evaluate the Program: Collect feedback from the participants to assess the effectiveness of the training program. This could involve surveys, interviews, or observation.

10. Make Improvements: Based on the feedback, make necessary improvements to the training program. This could involve updating the curriculum, changing the trainers, or adjusting the logistics.

11. Plan for Future Programs: Based on the success of the training program, plan for future programs. This could involve scheduling regular training sessions, expanding the topics covered, or targeting other groups of healthcare professionals.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Conduct a needs assessment to understand the current knowledge level and skills of primary care physicians in early cancer detection and referral

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Define the Purpose: Clearly define the purpose of the needs assessment. The goal is to understand the current knowledge level and skills of primary care physicians in early cancer detection and referral.

2. Identify Stakeholders: Identify the key stakeholders involved in this process. This could include primary care physicians, hospital administrators, and patients.

3. Develop a Survey: Develop a comprehensive survey to gauge the current knowledge and skills of primary care physicians. The survey should include questions about their understanding of early cancer detection, their comfort level with making referrals, and their perceived areas of weakness.

4. Distribute the Survey: Distribute the survey to the identified primary care physicians. This could be done through email, in-person meetings, or through an online survey tool.

5. Collect Responses: Allow a set period of time for the physicians to complete the survey. Send reminders as necessary to ensure a high response rate.

6. Analyze the Data: Once all responses have been collected, analyze the data to identify trends and areas of concern. This could involve calculating averages, identifying common themes, and noting areas where many physicians seem to struggle.

7. Conduct Interviews: Based on the survey results, select a few physicians for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of their knowledge and skills. 

8. Analyze Interview Data: Analyze the data collected from the interviews. Look for common themes and areas of concern that were not apparent in the survey data.
