6. Consider Health Habits: Consider the health habits of your target audience. This could include factors like their diet, exercise routine, and whether they smoke or drink alcohol. For example, a campaign for a new health food product might target people who follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly.

7. Create Audience Profiles: Based on the factors above, create detailed profiles of your target audience. These profiles should include information about their age, gender, lifestyle, and health habits. 

8. Test Your Assumptions: Once you have identified your target audience, test your assumptions. This could involve conducting surveys or focus groups to gather feedback from people who fit your target audience profiles.

9. Refine Your Audience: Based on the feedback you receive, refine your target audience. You may need to adjust your audience profiles or consider additional factors.

10. Finalize Your Target Audience: Once you have tested and refined your assumptions, finalize your target audience. This is the group of people that you will focus on for your campaign.
