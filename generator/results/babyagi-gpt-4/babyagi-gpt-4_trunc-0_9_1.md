Summary: 
The AI model suggested a multi-step approach to structuring a policy or research strategy aimed at reducing population exposure to hazardous substances. This includes identifying the problem, defining the scope, setting objectives, and brainstorming solutions. The AI model suggested evaluating solutions for effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, practicality and potential side-effects before the creation of a policy or research strategy. Once the strategy is developed, it is to be shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback, revised based on this feedback, and subsequently implemented. Regular monitoring and evaluation processes are recommended to assure effectiveness and make necessary improvements. 

Main Ideas: 
- Recognize and understand the problem, ways of exposure, affected areas, and population groups at risk.
- Generate, evaluate and select potential solutions for feasibility, effectiveness, potential side effects, cost and benefits.
- Formulate a comprehensive policy or research strategy, incorporating feedback from relevant stakeholders.
- Implement, regularly monitor, and fine-tune the policy or research strategy based on its effectiveness and outcomes.
