3. Identify and secure various potential sources of funding including corporate sponsorship, government and non-government grants, partnerships with educational institutions, crowdfunding, and individual donors.

Main Finding:
1. The course content, learning objectives, and potential outcomes are instrumental in structuring the syllabus and identifying potential funding sources aligned with the program's objectives.
2. Continuous updates and regular assessments ensure that the syllabus stays relevant and effective.
3. Diversification of the funding sources can potentially enhance the financial stability of the training program.
