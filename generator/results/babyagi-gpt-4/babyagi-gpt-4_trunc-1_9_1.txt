2. Develop a Communication Plan: Develop a plan for communicating with the stakeholders. This should include the methods of communication, the frequency of communication, and the information to be communicated.
3. Conduct a Risk Assessment: Conduct a risk assessment to understand the potential risks associated with each identified hazardous substance. This should include the likelihood of exposure, the severity of the potential health effects, and the vulnerability of the different population groups.
4. Prioritize Hazardous Substances: Based on the risk assessment, prioritize the hazardous substances that need to be addressed first. This should take into account the severity of the potential health effects and the number of people exposed.
5. Develop a Risk Management Plan: Develop a plan for managing the risks associated with each prioritized hazardous substance. This should include measures for reducing exposure, mitigating health effects, and monitoring the situation.
6. Train Staff: Train the staff who will be involved in implementing the plan. This should include training on the nature of the hazardous substances, the potential health effects, the methods for reducing exposure, and the procedures for monitoring the situation.
7. Conduct a Pilot Test: Conduct a pilot test of the plan with a small group of people. This will help to identify any problems or issues that need to be addressed before the plan is implemented on a larger scale.
8. Review and Refine the Plan: Based on the results of the pilot test, review and refine the plan. Make any necessary changes to ensure that the plan is effective and practical.
9. Develop a Contingency Plan: Develop a contingency plan for dealing with any unexpected situations or problems that may arise during the implementation of the plan.
10. Conduct Regular Reviews: Conduct regular reviews of the plan to ensure that it is still relevant and effective. Make any necessary changes based on new information or changes in the situation.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify HighRisk Groups Define the scope of the problem by determining the population groups most at risk the sources of exposure and the geographical areas most affected

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review Health Impact Assessment: Start by reviewing the Health Impact Assessment that was previously conducted. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential health effects of each identified hazardous substance.

2. Identify Hazardous Substances: List down all the hazardous substances identified in the Health Impact Assessment. 

3. Analyze Health Effects: Analyze the health effects of each hazardous substance on different population groups. This will help in identifying the groups that are most at risk.
