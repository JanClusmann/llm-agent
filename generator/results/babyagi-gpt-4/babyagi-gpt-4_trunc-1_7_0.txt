*****OBJECTIVE*****

Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources.

Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Determine the specific goals and objectives of the policy

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Begin by reviewing the scope of the policy that has been previously defined. Understand the specific areas of cancer research and the countries or regions involved in the cooperation.

2. Conduct a brainstorming session to identify potential goals and objectives for the policy. Consider the needs of the cancer research field, the capabilities of the countries or regions involved, and the overall purpose of the policy.

3. Write down all ideas that come up during the brainstorming session. Do not discard any ideas at this stage.

4. Review the ideas and start grouping them into categories. These categories could be based on the type of cancer research (e.g., clinical trials, genetic research, etc.), the stage of research (e.g., early-stage, advanced, etc.), or the expected outcomes (e.g., new treatments, improved patient care, etc.).

5. For each category, define specific goals. These goals should be clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

6. Once the goals are defined, break them down into smaller, more specific objectives. These objectives should outline the steps needed to achieve each goal.

7. Review the goals and objectives to ensure they align with the scope of the policy and the needs of the cancer research field.

8. Seek feedback on the goals and objectives from key stakeholders. This could include researchers, policy makers, healthcare providers, and patient advocacy groups.

9. Revise the goals and objectives based on the feedback received.

10. Finalize the goals and objectives of the policy. Ensure they are clearly communicated to all parties involved in the policy's implementation. 

11. Establish a process for monitoring and evaluating the progress towards achieving these goals and objectives. This will help ensure the policy is effective and can be adjusted as needed.

****TASK CREATION AGENT RESPONSE****
1. Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) for each goal and objective of the policy.
2. Develop a detailed implementation plan for each objective, outlining the specific steps, resources needed, and responsible parties.
3. Create a timeline for each objective, specifying when each step should be completed.
4. Develop a contingency plan for potential challenges or obstacles that may arise during the implementation of the policy.
5. Identify potential synergies between the policy and other existing policies or initiatives in the field of cancer research.
6. Develop a plan for regular internal reviews of the policy's progress and effectiveness.
7. Establish a protocol for making adjustments to the policy based on the findings from the internal reviews and evaluations.
8. Develop a strategy for maintaining stakeholder engagement and motivation throughout the implementation of the policy.
9. Create a plan for recognizing and rewarding the contributions of stakeholders to the policy's implementation.
10. Develop a strategy for leveraging the policy to attract additional funding or resources for cancer research.
11. Establish a protocol for documenting and sharing the lessons learned during the policy's implementation.
12. Develop a plan for scaling up the policy if it proves to be effective.
13. Create a strategy for integrating the policy into the broader strategic plans of the countries or regions involved.
14. Develop a plan for disseminating the results and impacts of the policy to a wider audience.
15. Establish a protocol for the regular review and updating of the policy's goals and objectives based on evolving needs and circumstances.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Conduct a literature review of existing policies or strategies related to international cooperation in cancer research

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Identify the Scope: Define the scope of the literature review by identifying the specific areas of international cooperation in cancer research you want to focus on. This could include areas like funding, research collaborations, data sharing, etc.

2. Develop a Search Strategy: Develop a strategy for searching the literature. This could include identifying key words and phrases related to international cooperation in cancer research, and deciding on the types of sources you want to include (e.g., academic articles, policy documents, reports, etc.).

3. Search for Literature: Begin searching for literature based on your search strategy. This could involve searching in academic databases, policy databases, and other relevant sources. 

4. Screen the Literature: Screen the literature you find based on your defined scope. This could involve reading the abstracts or summaries of the documents to determine if they are relevant to your review.

5. Analyze the Literature: Analyze the literature you have selected. This could involve identifying the main points, arguments, and findings of each document, and noting any trends or patterns across the literature.

6. Synthesize the Findings: Synthesize the findings from your analysis. This could involve summarizing the main points, arguments, and findings from the literature, and drawing conclusions about the state of international cooperation in cancer research.
