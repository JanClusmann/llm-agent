Summary: 
The AI model suggested to initially understand the present state of international cooperation in cancer research, which includes existing collaborations, strategies, and policies. It recommended identifying the areas needing improvement, such as communication or resource sharing, and then brainstorming potential solutions. Based on these, a preliminary strategy or policy should be created, including clear objectives, roles and responsibilities. This draft should be reviewed and refined with the team and stakeholders' feedback before it is finalized and shared with all the relevant stakeholders. The implementation of the policy would involve setting up new communication channels, organizing collaborative research projects, or providing resources for international cooperation, and its effectiveness should be regularly evaluated to make necessary adjustments. 

Main Ideas: 
- Start by understanding the present state of international cooperation in cancer research and identify gaps that need improvement.
- Develop a draft policy or strategy based on the brainstorming session and review it with your team and stakeholders.
- Finalize the policy or strategy after incorporating feedback and share it with all the relevant stakeholders.
- Implement the policy and monitor its effectiveness regularly to make necessary adjustments.
