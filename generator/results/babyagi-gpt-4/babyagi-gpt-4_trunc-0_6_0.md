Summary: 
The AI proposed a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of life for cancer survivors consisting of review, research, policy development and implementation steps. These begin with a review of the existing curriculum on early cancer detection, then identifying the needs to cancer survivors and conducting an extensive literature review on the subject. Based on this information, the AI proposes the development of a research question, the design of a research strategy, and finally the formulation of a supportive policy for cancer patients.

Main Ideas: 
- Examination of current curriculum on early cancer detection and referral and identify the needs of cancer survivors.
- Conducting a comprehensive literature review on the same subject.
- Based on the collected data, development of the research question, designing a research strategy, and policy formulation.

Main Finding: 
- There is a need to understand intimately cancer survivors' needs.
- A research strategy has to be designed to answer specifically the research questions identified.
- Ultimately, a policy proposal must be developed, tested, refined, and implemented to improve the lives of cancer survivors.
