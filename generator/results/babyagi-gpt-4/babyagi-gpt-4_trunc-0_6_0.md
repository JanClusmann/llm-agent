## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggested to begin by evaluating the existing curriculum on early cancer detection and referral, understanding the key points, theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and case studies. Later, recognizing the physical, emotional, social, and financial requirements of cancer survivors via introspection and creativity is advocated. A literature review to comprehend the existing research and identify gaps is then recommended. Formulating a research question aiming to improve cancer survivors' quality of life and strategizing research are suggested steps. The model recommends formulating policy changes based on the research findings and later testing this proposal with a pilot study, revising it based on feedback. The refined policy should be implemented on a larger scale, monitored, evaluated, and adjusted as needed.

Main Ideas: 
- Evaluate existing curriculum and recognize survival needs of cancer patients.
- Conduct literature review and formulate research question.
- Develop a research strategy and create a policy proposal based on the findings.
- Conduct pilot study, refine the policy, fully implement, evaluate, and adjust as required.
