Summary: 
The AI model suggested to create a comprehensive policy to reduce exposure to hazardous substances by organizing a list of pertinent stakeholders and developing strategic tasks to mitigate environmental impact. The plan began with identifying government agencies, industries, communities, environmental organizations, and other relevant stakeholders involved in the environmental issue. Then, the AI proposed a series of tasks to systematically reduce the environmental harm caused by hazardous substances. Proposed plans varied from source tracking, constant inspections and updates to disposal sites, developing databases, conducting comprehensive research, policy proposals, and implementing educational programs about the substance impacts among other tasks.

Main Ideas: 
- Identify and organize stakeholders in relation to hazardous substances, including government agencies, environmental organizations, industries, affected communities, or other parties such as media or legal representation.
- Develop numerous tasks including tracking the transportation and disposal of hazardous substances, researching environmental impact, conducting risk assessments, brainstorming potential solutions, and drafting a policy proposal.
- Implement robust feedback policy through regular assessments, updates, adjustments, and education to involve population actively.
- Collaborate with environmental organizations and research institutions for continuous study and understanding of the impacts, and establish a system for population to report suspected environmental impacts.
