Summary: 
The proposed approach for a training program for primary care physicians on early cancer detection and referral consists of defining learning objectives, designing a comprehensive curriculum, and establishing mechanisms for participant feedback and curriculum improvement. Touching upon necessary topics like early cancer signs, patient communication techniques, and referral procedures, the system also aims to maintain physician engagement post-training and provide ongoing support. A pilot run is also suggested before the full-scale implementation of the program.

Main Ideas:
- Detailed learning objectives targeting knowledge gaps of physicians
- Comprehensive curriculum design involving interactive learning and assessments
- Foresight of participant feedback, pilot run, and ongoing support post-training implementation.

Main Finding:
- Need for a needs-based training program focused on oncology for primary care physicians.
- Importance of interactive learning components in the curriculum for effective training.
- Plan for a flexible and upgradable curriculum based on feedback and latest research.
