Summary: 
The AI model suggested a hypothetical approach to reducing tobacco consumption in a specific European country. First, the country with high tobacco consumption rates needs to be identified. Next, data on current tobacco consumption rates, health impacts, and existing policies should be gathered. The gathered data should be analyzed for understanding smoker demographics, causes for smoking, and present policy effectiveness. The model then proposes brainstorming potential solutions like tax augmentation on tobacco, stricter advertising regulations, and smoking cessation programs. These solutions need an evaluation keeping in mind feasibility, potential impact, cost, and possible resistance from tobacco companies and smokers. After drafting a comprehensive policy considering the most effective solutions, a review for clarity, comprehensiveness, and feasibility should occur. The AI also recommends stakeholder consultation and subsequent revisions based on their feedback. After making a finalized policy, it should be implemented in phases. Moreover, the policy implementation must be monitored, constantly evaluated for its impact on tobacco consumption rates and necessary adjustments should be made. Lastly, the policy outcomes should be reported to the government, the public, and other stakeholders, and continuous policy improvement based on feedback and outcomes is recommended.

Main Ideas: 
- Gathering and analyzing data about tobacco consumption, health impacts, and existing policies in a country.
