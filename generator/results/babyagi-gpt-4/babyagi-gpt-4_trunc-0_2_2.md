Summary: 
The AI model suggested a step-by-step policy approach to curtail tobacco consumption in a specific European country. The proposed method includes identifying high tobacco consuming countries in Europe, mainly by analyzing data from health reports, surveys, and databases. Brainstorming potential policies like increasing taxes or stricter advertising regulations is suggested after examining the demographics of smokers and the effectiveness of existing policies. The model then proposes drafting a policy, sharing it with stakeholders for feedback, finalizing it, and implementing it via the appropriate government branches. The executed policy would be monitored for its effectiveness, and necessary adjustments would be made over time to ensure its continued viability. Moreover, the model suggests actions beyond policy formation, such as stakeholder identification, investigation of the tobacco industry, healthcare system study, researching successful anti-tobacco campaigns, and developing a communication strategy to educate the public about the perils of tobacco consumption.

Main Ideas: 
- Identify a specific European country with high tobacco consumption through rigorous data analysis
- Brainstorm potential policies after understanding the demographics of smokers and analyzing the efficiency of existing policies
- Draft a detailed policy, share it with stakeholders for feedback, finalize it, and collaborate with relevant government departments for implementation
- Continuously monitor and adjust the policy to ensure it remains effective in reducing tobacco consumption over time
