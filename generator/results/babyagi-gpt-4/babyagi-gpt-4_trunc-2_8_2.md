## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI uses introspection and creativity to strategize on how wearable technology can be used in cancer detection, focusing on data types these devices could collect such as heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity levels. It frames a detailed plan, involving public education, obtaining permissions, addressing potentials risks/benefits, and regular collaboration with researchers. Furthermore, it identifies potential cancer indicators through wearable data like sudden weight loss or consistent high heart rate. 

Main Ideas: 
- Using the data from wearable technology for cancer detection.
- Developing a plan for public education, permissions, technical challenges, and risk/benefit management.
- Identifying potential cancer signs using data collected by wearable technology.

Main Finding: 
- Identified potential types of wearable tech data that could help in cancer detection.
- Details a comprehensive approach on how to use wearable technology in cancer screening.
- Lists potential indicators related to cancer that can be detected through wearable tech data.
