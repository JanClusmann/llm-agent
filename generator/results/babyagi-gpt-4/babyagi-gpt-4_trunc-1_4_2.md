Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive approach to integrate recent technological advances into personalized cancer care. The strategy began by comprehending healthcare providers' challenges and applying technological enhancements, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, genomics, and telemedicine, to resolve these issues. The model proposed utilizing creativity to create novel ways to leverage these technologies effectively. The ideas' feasibility was scrutinised with factors like cost, technical feasibility, and their acceptance by patients and healthcare providers. The next step involved identifying potential collaborators, designing a training program for healthcare providers, informing patients about the new technology, and creating a system to monitor the technology's outcomes. Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms were proposed for this new plan, with further steps describing how to manage the ethical issues, potential sources of funding, communication strategy, and timeline
