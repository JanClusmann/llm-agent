*****OBJECTIVE*****

Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources.

Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the strengths and weaknesses of these existing policies

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Gather all the literature and documents related to existing policies or strategies on international cooperation in cancer research. 

2. Begin by reading each document thoroughly. Understand the purpose, objectives, and strategies outlined in each policy.

3. Start the analysis by identifying the strengths of each policy. Look for aspects such as clarity of objectives, feasibility of strategies, inclusivity, and adaptability. 

4. Note down each strength in a separate document. Make sure to reference the policy it is associated with for easy tracking.

5. After identifying the strengths, move on to the weaknesses. Look for areas such as lack of clarity, unrealistic strategies, lack of inclusivity, and rigidity.

6. Note down each weakness in the same document, again making sure to reference the policy it is associated with.

7. Once all policies have been analyzed, review the list of strengths and weaknesses. Look for common themes or patterns. 

8. Categorize the strengths and weaknesses based on these common themes. This could include categories such as 'clarity of objectives', 'feasibility of strategies', 'inclusivity', and 'adaptability'.

9. Analyze these categories to gain a deeper understanding of the overall strengths and weaknesses of existing policies on international cooperation in cancer research.

10. Finally, prepare a comprehensive report detailing the strengths and weaknesses of these policies. Include specific examples from the policies to support your points. 

11. Review the report for accuracy and completeness before finalizing it. 

12. Use this analysis to inform future policy development or to propose improvements to existing policies.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the key themes and gaps in the existing policies from the literature review

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Gather all the existing policies and the literature review that has been done on them.
2. Start by reading through each policy one by one. As you read, make notes on the main themes that each policy covers.
3. Once you have read through all the policies, review your notes and identify the key themes that are common across multiple policies. These could be things like safety, efficiency, inclusivity, etc.
4. Now, go back to the literature review that was done on these policies. Look for any themes that were identified in the review that you may have missed in your own analysis.
5. Once you have a comprehensive list of themes, start looking for gaps. These could be themes that are important but are not covered in the existing policies.
6. To identify these gaps, think about the purpose of these policies and what they are trying to achieve. Then, brainstorm any themes that are important to achieving this purpose but are not currently covered in the policies.
7. Once you have identified these gaps, make a list of them. This list will be useful in the next step of the process, which is to develop new policies or revise existing ones to fill these gaps.
8. Finally, summarize your findings in a report. This report should include the key themes you identified, the gaps you found, and any recommendations you have for addressing these gaps.
