*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Identify the Target Audience: Start by identifying who your target audience is. This could be a specific demographic, a certain age group, a particular profession, or a cultural group. 

2. Understand the Audience: Research about the target audience's cultural background, language proficiency, literacy levels, and beliefs. This could be done through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. 

3. Identify Potential Language Barriers: Determine if the target audience speaks a different language or if they have varying levels of proficiency in the language the information is being presented in. 

4. Identify Potential Literacy Barriers: Assess the literacy levels of the target audience. This could be done through surveys or tests. If the audience has low literacy levels, they may struggle to understand written information.

5. Identify Potential Cultural Barriers: Understand the cultural beliefs of the target audience. Certain cultures may interpret information differently or may have beliefs that conflict with the information being presented.

6. Identify Potential Socioeconomic Barriers: Consider the socioeconomic status of the target audience. People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have less access to resources to understand the information.

7. Identify Potential Technological Barriers: Determine if the target audience has access to the technology needed to receive the information. This could include computers, internet access, or specific software.

8. Develop Strategies to Overcome Barriers: Once the potential barriers have been identified, develop strategies to overcome them. This could include translating information into different languages, simplifying complex information, or presenting information in a culturally sensitive way.

9. Test the Strategies: Implement the strategies on a small scale to test their effectiveness. This could involve presenting the information to a small group from the target audience and gathering feedback.

10. Refine the Strategies: Based on the feedback, refine the strategies as needed. This could involve making the information even simpler, using different translations, or presenting the information in a different way.

11. Implement the Strategies: Once the strategies have been refined, implement them on a larger scale. Monitor the effectiveness of the strategies and continue to refine them as needed. 

12. Evaluate the Outcome: After the information has been presented, evaluate the outcome. Did the target audience understand the information? If not, identify what barriers still exist and develop new strategies to overcome them.
