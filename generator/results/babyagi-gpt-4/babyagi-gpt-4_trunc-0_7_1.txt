*****NEXT TASK*****

Conduct a comprehensive literature review to understand the current state of international cooperation in cancer research and identify the gaps in existing policies

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope of your literature review. This should include the specific areas of cancer research you will focus on, the countries or regions of interest, and the time period you will cover.

2. Identify Relevant Sources: Identify the databases and other sources where you will find relevant literature. This could include academic databases, government reports, policy documents, and publications from international organizations.

3. Develop Search Strategy: Develop a search strategy that includes the key terms and phrases you will use to find relevant literature. This could include terms like "international cooperation", "cancer research", "policy", and "strategy".

4. Conduct Search: Conduct your search using the strategy you developed. Be sure to keep track of the sources you find for later reference.

5. Screen and Select Literature: Screen the literature you found based on its relevance to your scope. Select the most relevant sources for further review.

6. Analyze and Synthesize Literature: Analyze the selected literature to understand the current state of international cooperation in cancer research. Look for common themes, trends, and gaps in the literature.
