5. Generate Ideas: Brainstorm potential solutions to reduce exposure to these substances. This could involve developing new technologies, changing industrial practices, or implementing new regulations.

6. Evaluate Potential Solutions: Assess the feasibility and effectiveness of each potential solution. Consider the costs, benefits, and potential obstacles for each option.

7. Develop a Policy Proposal: Based on your research and evaluation, develop a policy proposal to reduce exposure to these hazardous substances. This should include specific actions to be taken, a timeline for implementation, and a plan for monitoring and evaluation.

8. Communicate the Policy: Present the policy proposal to the key stakeholders. This could involve meetings, presentations, or written reports.

9. Implement the Policy: If the policy is approved, begin the process of implementation. This could involve coordinating with various agencies, providing training, or allocating resources.

10. Monitor and Evaluate: Regularly monitor the situation to assess the effectiveness of the policy. This could involve conducting surveys, analyzing data, or conducting site visits. Based on this evaluation, make any necessary adjustments to the policy. 

11. Review and Update: Regularly review and update the policy to ensure it remains effective and relevant. This could involve conducting additional research, consulting with stakeholders, or revising the policy based on new information or changes in the situation.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the specific hazardous substances that the population is exposed to

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Start by defining what constitutes a hazardous substance: This could include substances that are toxic, corrosive, flammable, reactive, or radioactive.

2. Review existing literature and reports: Look at previous studies, reports, and surveys that have been conducted on hazardous substances. This will give you an idea of what substances have been identified as hazardous in the past.

3. Conduct a survey: Develop a survey to gather information from the population about their exposure to hazardous substances. This could include questions about their occupation, lifestyle, and the products they use.

4. Analyze the data: Once you have collected the data, analyze it to identify patterns and trends. This will help you identify the most common hazardous substances that people are exposed to.

5. Conduct interviews: Interview professionals who work in fields that are known to involve exposure to hazardous substances. This could include people who work in industries such as manufacturing, construction, and healthcare.

6. Visit sites: Visit various sites such as factories, construction sites, and hospitals to observe the types of hazardous substances that are used and how they are handled.

7. Consult with experts: Consult with experts in the field of toxicology and environmental health to gain their insights on what substances are considered hazardous.

8. Compile a list: Based on your findings, compile a list of the specific hazardous substances that the population is exposed to.

9. Review and refine the list: Review the list and refine it as necessary. You may need to conduct further research or consult with more experts to ensure that your list is comprehensive and accurate.

10. Finalize the list: Once you are satisfied with your list, finalize it. This list will serve as the basis for your policy or research strategy to reduce the population's exposure to these hazardous substances.
