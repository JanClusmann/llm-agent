*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope of your literature review. This should include the type of cancer survivors you are focusing on, the aspects of quality of life you are interested in, and the time frame of the studies you will include.

2. Develop a Research Question: Formulate a research question that will guide your literature review. This question should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

3. Identify Relevant Databases: Identify the databases that are most likely to contain relevant literature. These could include PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and others.

4. Develop Search Terms: Develop a list of search terms related to your research question. These should include synonyms, related terms, and variations in spelling.

5. Conduct the Search: Use your search terms to conduct a search in each of the identified databases. Be sure to document your search strategy for each database.

6. Screen the Results: Screen the titles and abstracts of the results to identify potentially relevant studies. Exclude studies that do not meet your inclusion criteria.

7. Retrieve Full Texts: Retrieve the full texts of potentially relevant studies. If a study is not available online, you may need to request it through interlibrary loan.

8. Assess the Quality of the Studies: Use a standardized tool to assess the quality of each study. This could include assessing the study design, sample size, measurement tools, and statistical analyses.

9. Extract Data: Extract relevant data from each study. This could include the study's aim, methods, results, and conclusions.

10. Synthesize the Findings: Synthesize the findings from the included studies. This could involve grouping studies by theme, comparing and contrasting findings, and identifying gaps in the literature.

11. Write the Literature Review: Write up your literature review, including an introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Be sure to clearly state your research question, describe your search strategy, present your findings, and discuss the implications of your findings for future research.

12. Review and Edit: Review and edit your literature review to ensure it is clear, concise, and free of errors. You may want to ask a colleague or mentor to review it as well.

13. Submit for Publication: If appropriate, submit your literature review for publication in a relevant journal. Be sure to follow the journal's submission guidelines.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the key stakeholders who will be involved in the curriculum development and policy proposal process

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the literature: Go through the literature review that was previously conducted to understand the context and the key players involved in the quality of life of cancer survivors.

2. Identify the target audience: Determine who the curriculum and policy proposal will directly affect. This will likely include cancer survivors, their families, and healthcare providers.

3. Identify healthcare professionals: Identify the healthcare professionals who are directly involved in the care of cancer survivors. This may include oncologists, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and other allied health professionals.
