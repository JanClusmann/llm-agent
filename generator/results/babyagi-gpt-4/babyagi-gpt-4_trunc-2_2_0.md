Summary: 
The AI model suggested a three-staged hypothetical approach to design policy on reducing tobacco consumption. First, it considered a historical analysis, starting with identification of the country, gathering initial information about the country's history with tobacco, identifying key periods, researching trends and patterns during these periods, considering cultural and societal factors, analyzing the data, drawing conclusions, documenting the findings, and finally reviewing and refining the work. The second stage involved identifying the demographic trends in tobacco use. Key demographic groups would be defined, a survey would then be constructed, which would be distributed, collected, analyzed, and interpreted. A report would be written, reviewed, and findings would be presented to relevant stakeholders. The third stage involved engaging with a broad diversity of stakeholders to understand their perspectives, this ranged from tobacco farmers, healthcare professionals, and the public to representatives from international health organizations, NGOs, educational institutions, law enforcement, government, and even the tobacco industry itself.

Main Ideas: 
- Conduct historical research on tobacco consumption in the country, split into key periods and includes societal factors
- Understand demographic patterns of tobacco consumption through surveys and then analyze and interpret the data
- Engage with a wide array of stakeholders from various institutions and sectors regarding their perspectives on tobacco consumption
