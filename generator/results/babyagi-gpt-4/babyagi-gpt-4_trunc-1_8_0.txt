*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the specific types of cancer that the policy will focus on

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the existing policies and strategies: Go through the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the existing policies and strategies. This will give you an idea of what types of cancer have been focused on in the past and where there might be gaps in coverage.

2. Identify the most common types of cancer: Using your knowledge and any available resources, identify the most common types of cancer. These will likely be a priority for any policy.

3. Consider the most deadly types of cancer: While some types of cancer are more common, others are more deadly. These types of cancer may also need to be a focus of the policy.

4. Think about the types of cancer that are preventable: Some types of cancer can be prevented through lifestyle changes or vaccinations. These types of cancer might be a focus of the policy, as prevention strategies can be very cost-effective.

5. Consider the types of cancer that are most treatable: Some types of cancer have a high survival rate if they are detected early and treated promptly. These types of cancer might also be a focus of the policy.

6. Think about the types of cancer that are most prevalent in your specific region or population: If the policy is for a specific region or population, consider the types of cancer that are most common in that area or among those people.

7. Consider the types of cancer that have a high cost of treatment: Some types of cancer are very expensive to treat. These might be a focus of the policy, as reducing the cost of treatment could be a major goal.

8. Prioritize the types of cancer: Based on all of the above considerations, prioritize the types of cancer that the policy will focus on. This will likely involve some difficult decisions, as it may not be possible to focus on all types of cancer equally.

9. Document your decisions: Write down the types of cancer that the policy will focus on and the reasons for these decisions. This will be important for communicating the focus of the policy to others and for evaluating the policy in the future. 

10. Review and revise: Regularly review and revise the focus of the policy as new information becomes available. This could include new research on the causes and treatment of cancer, changes in the prevalence of different types of cancer, and feedback from people affected by the policy.
