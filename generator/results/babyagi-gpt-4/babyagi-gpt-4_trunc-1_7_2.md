## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggested a two-step process to boost international cooperation in cancer research. Firstly, it proposed a thorough analysis of existing cooperation dynamics, covering organizations involved, their roles, existing policies, strategies, collaborations and their effectiveness. The insights from this review would then be compiled into a report. The second part entailed designing a policy based on the findings, which emphasised a comparative analysis of policies and strategies from different organizations, a centralized database for sharing research findings, a roadmap for the policy implementation, risk assessment, capacity building, a peer-review system to maintain quality, a dissemination plan, a feedback mechanism, celebration of implementation milestones and establishment of a research advisory board, a recognition and award system, and a research ethics committee.

Main Ideas: 
- Understand the current landscape of international cooperation in cancer research by comprehensively analyzing existing policies, strategies, and collaborations.
- Develop an approach for strengthening international cooperation based on the insights from the review, focusing on open data access, policy implementation, peer-review system, and establishment of relevant bodies and mechanisms.
