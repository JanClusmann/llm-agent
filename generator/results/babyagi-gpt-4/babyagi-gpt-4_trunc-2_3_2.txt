*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the list of identified stakeholders: Start by reviewing the list of stakeholders that have been identified. This list should include all individuals, groups, or organizations that have a vested interest in the program and its outcomes.

For example, investors might be interested in the financial return, while employees might be interested in job security or career development opportunities.

5. Understand stakeholder expectations: Beyond their interests, it's also important to understand what each stakeholder expects from the program. This could be in terms of performance, communication, or involvement.

6. Analyze potential conflicts: There may be conflicts between the interests of different stakeholders. Identify these potential conflicts and consider how they could impact the program.

7. Develop a stakeholder engagement strategy: Based on the understanding of stakeholder interests, develop a strategy for engaging with each stakeholder. This could include regular communication, involvement in decision-making, or addressing their specific interests and expectations.
