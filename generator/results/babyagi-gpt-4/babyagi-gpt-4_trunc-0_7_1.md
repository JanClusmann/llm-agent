Summary: 
The AI model suggested to commence the policy design process with a thorough literature review to understand the current state of international cooperation in cancer research and identify the gaps in existing policies. Once the review is completed, the model advises brainstorming with the team to generate innovative ideas that address the identified gaps. Moreover, recognizing the key stakeholders in international cancer research is emphasized. Following, the AI model suggests creating a policy or research strategy, involving a cycle of drafting, reviewing, and revising, to ensure clarity, succinctness, and actionability, before organizing meetings with stakeholders to present the draft. The feedback gathered should then be used to finalize the policy or strategy and an implementation plan. To ensure the long-term success and relevance of the policy, the model advises monitoring its effectiveness over time, adjusting it as necessary based on results and feedback, and conducting regular reviews and updates.
