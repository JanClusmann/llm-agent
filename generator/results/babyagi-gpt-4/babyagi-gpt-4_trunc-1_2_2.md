Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive multi-step approach to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country. It started with stakeholders' identification, including government entities, tobacco industry, health organizations, consumer groups, the medical community, NGOs, media, academic institutions, trade unions, and the general public. It recommended a thorough documentation of stakeholders' interests and influences. Subsequently, the model proposed to identify cultural, social, and economic influencers, establish a database, develop an analytical framework, identify funding sources, and create communication strategies. The model also advocated for foreseeing and planning to handle potential legal challenges, stakeholder engagement, and maintaining transparency and accountability. The AI equally stressed the importance of researching the history of tobacco consumption in the country while considering cultural, social, and economic factors.
