Summary: 
AI model proposes an in-depth analysis based policy for a single European country, starting with data collection from various reliable sources about current tobacco consumption rates, following with a comprehensive study of factors influencing tobacco use like cultural norms, socioeconomic status, mass media influence etc. The model then suggests an analysis to understand the demographics of smokers and reasons for smoking, leading to insights that can be used to implement targeted interventions. In the end, the model emphasises reiteration of the process for continued relevance and efficiency of the interventions.

Main Ideas:
