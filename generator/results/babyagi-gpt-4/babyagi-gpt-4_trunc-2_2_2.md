Summary: 
The AI model proposed a multi-step approach to formulating a policy aimed at reducing tobacco consumption in a specific European country. It begins with in-depth research on the selected country's tobacco consumption rates through multiple resources, analysis of the collected data, and report writing outlining the findings. It also suggests identifying various factors such as cultural norms, socioeconomic status, media influence, and corporate roles in shaping tobacco use. The AI advises studying the broader impacts of tobacco consumption like domestic violence, environmental health, and health disparities. Finally, it proposes data analysis on demographics of smokers and their smoking reasons, report generation, potential solution brainstorming and implementation. Periodically, the process must be repeated to capture changes in trends.

Main Ideas: 
- Conduct extensive research on tobacco usage rates and factors influencing it in the chosen country by employing governmental and non-governmental resources, library research, and contacting experts.
- Study the wider effects of tobacco usage on societal parameters like quality of life, education, career progression, and health disparities.
- Analyze the demographic data along with the reasons for smoking. 
- Formulate possible solutions based on the insights and continuously monitor and adjust these strategies as per the changing demographic trends and reasons for smoking.
