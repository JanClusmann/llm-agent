Summary: 
The AI model suggested developing a comprehensive system to manage exposure to hazardous substances by first conducting a thorough risk assessment, identifying areas of exposure, and evaluating the susceptibility of the exposed population. Then, it advised the development of a risk management plan, communication strategies, and regular updates. The model also emphasized the role of stakeholders, implementation of the policy, and its regular review to ensure its effectiveness.

Main Ideas: 
- Conduct a proper risk assessment including collection of data about the hazardous substances, exposure routes, frequency, and duration of exposure. 
- Develop a risk management plan based on risk assessment findings. 
- Use effective communication strategies to share the risk assessment results and risk management plan with all relevant stakeholders.
  
Main Finding: 
- Risk assessment helps to identify, evaluate, and manage risks posed by hazardous substances.
- Ongoing communication with stakeholders is crucial to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the risk assessment.
- Reviewing and updating the risk assessments regularly can ensure the continued feasibility, novelty, and correctness of the approach towards managing the hazardous substances.

Novelty: 
10 - The AI model presents a comprehensive plan, not just focusing on policy or law enforcement, but also on risk assessments and stakeholder engagement.

Feasibility: 
8 - The resources and infrastructure required to execute the outlined steps may vary, making this approach highly dependent on the context.

Correctness: 
10 - The approach adheres to standard steps in managing health and safety risks related to hazardous substances, including risk assessment, communication, and regular reviews. These steps are universally recognized as best practices in this field.
