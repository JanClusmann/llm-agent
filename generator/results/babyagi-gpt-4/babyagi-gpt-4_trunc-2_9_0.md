Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive system to mitigate exposure to carcinogenic substances. It proposed risk assessments to determine the type, toxicity, and potential routes of exposure of the substances. The frequency, duration, and concentration of exposure, as well as the predisposition of exposed populations, were to be evaluated. With this information, a risk management plan would be tailored for each substance. The model also proposed the development of tools for tracking properties of new substances and updating the public on related risks. Also, it suggested formulating strategies to lessen exposure, prioritize substances based on severity, and assess the cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and policy implementation for controlling these substances. Further, educating the public, engaging with regulatory bodies, and offering support for affected individuals were highlighted.

Main Ideas: 
- Conduct risk assessments to understand exposure to hazardous substances and shape a risk management plan.
- Develop a system to monitor changes in the properties and uses of newly identified hazardous substances continuously.
- Formulate strategies to reduce exposure, prioritize substances based on the severity of their health effects, and assess the cost-effectiveness and environmental impact of the implemented policies.
- Engage with the public, provide education about the risks, and offer support to those affected.
