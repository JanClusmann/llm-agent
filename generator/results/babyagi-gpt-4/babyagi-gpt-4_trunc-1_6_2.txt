Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the key issues affecting the quality of life of cancer survivors such as physical health issues mental health issues and financial difficulties

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the Detailed Profile: Start by reviewing the detailed profile of the target group that was previously analyzed. This will provide a foundation for understanding the demographic information, types of cancer, and specific quality of life issues that have already been identified.

2. Identify Physical Health Issues: Look for any physical health issues that are common among cancer survivors. This could include long-term side effects from treatment, chronic pain, fatigue, or other physical limitations. 

3. Identify Mental Health Issues: Next, identify any mental health issues that are common among cancer survivors. This could include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other mental health conditions. 

4. Identify Financial Difficulties: Consider the financial difficulties that cancer survivors may face. This could include medical bills, loss of income due to inability to work, or other financial burdens. 

5. Prioritize Key Issues: Once you have identified the key issues affecting the quality of life of cancer survivors, prioritize them based on their prevalence and impact. This will help you focus on the most pressing issues.

6. Brainstorm Solutions: Use creativity and problem-solving strategies to brainstorm potential solutions for each of the key issues identified. 

7. Evaluate Solutions: Evaluate each potential solution based on its feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with the needs and preferences of the target group. 

8. Develop a Plan: Based on your evaluation, develop a plan to address the key issues affecting the quality of life of cancer survivors. This plan should include specific actions, timelines, and responsibilities.

9. Implement the Plan: Begin implementing the plan, monitoring progress and making adjustments as necessary.

10. Review and Reflect: After the plan has been implemented, review the results and reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Use this information to refine your approach and continue improving the quality of life for cancer survivors.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Conduct a thorough literature review on the quality of life issues faced by cancer survivors

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope of your literature review. This should include the specific aspects of quality of life issues faced by cancer survivors you want to focus on, such as physical health, mental health, and financial difficulties.

2. Identify Relevant Sources: Start by identifying the sources that you will use for your literature review. These could include books, academic journals, reports, and other scholarly publications. Remember, the sources should be credible and relevant to your topic.

3. Gather Materials: Visit libraries, bookstores, or use online databases to gather the materials you need. Make sure to check the publication date to ensure the information is current and relevant.

4. Read and Evaluate: Read through each source, making notes of key points, arguments, and findings. Evaluate the credibility of the source and the quality of the evidence provided.

5. Organize Your Findings: Organize your findings in a logical manner. This could be by issue (physical health, mental health, financial difficulties), by the type of cancer, or by the stage of survivorship.

6. Analyze and Interpret: Analyze and interpret the information you have gathered. Look for patterns, trends, and gaps in the literature. 

7. Write the Review: Begin writing your literature review. Start with an introduction that outlines the scope and objectives of the review. Then, present your findings, discussing each key issue in turn. Make sure to cite your sources correctly.

8. Review and Revise: Review your literature review for clarity, coherence, and accuracy. Make any necessary revisions.

9. Finalize: Once you are satisfied with your review, finalize it. This could involve formatting it according to specific guidelines, adding a bibliography, or preparing it for publication or presentation.

10. Share Your Findings: Share your findings with relevant stakeholders. This could include fellow researchers, healthcare professionals, cancer survivors, and advocacy groups. 

Remember, conducting a literature review is a complex process that requires critical thinking, careful planning, and meticulous execution. It's important to stay organized and focused throughout the process.
