3. Analyze the objectives: The objectives are specific, measurable goals that the program aims to achieve. They should be aligned with the mission. Read through each objective and consider whether it is clear, realistic, and aligned with the mission.

4. Compare the mission and objectives with the SWOT analysis: The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats identified in the SWOT analysis should be relevant to the mission and objectives. For example, a strength might be a unique capability that helps the program achieve its mission, while a weakness might be a gap or deficiency that hinders the achievement of an objective.

5. Identify any inconsistencies or gaps: If there are any inconsistencies between the mission, objectives, and SWOT analysis, or if there are any gaps (e.g., an important objective that is not being addressed), make a note of these.

6. Brainstorm solutions: Use your creativity and problem-solving skills to come up with potential solutions to any problems you've identified. For example, if an objective is not being addressed, you might come up with a new strategy or initiative to address it.

7. Write a report: Write a report summarizing your findings and recommendations. This report can be used to inform decision-making and strategic planning.

8. Share your findings: Share your report with the relevant stakeholders (e.g., program managers, staff, board members). This could involve presenting your findings at a meeting, or distributing the report via email.

9. Implement changes: Based on the feedback you receive, implement any necessary changes to the program's mission, objectives, or strategies.

10. Monitor progress: After changes have been implemented, continue to monitor the program's progress towards its objectives. This could involve regular check-ins, progress reports, or other forms of monitoring.
