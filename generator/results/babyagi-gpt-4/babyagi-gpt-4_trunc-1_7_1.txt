*****OBJECTIVE*****

Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources.

Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the key stakeholders in international cancer research including research institutions healthcare organizations governments and nonprofit organizations

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the literature: Start by reviewing the comprehensive literature that was previously gathered. This will provide a solid foundation of knowledge about the current state of international cooperation in cancer research and the gaps in existing policies.

2. Identify key stakeholders: Using the information from the literature review, identify the key stakeholders in international cancer research. These may include research institutions, healthcare organizations, governments, and nonprofit organizations.

3. Categorize stakeholders: Divide the stakeholders into categories based on their roles and responsibilities. For example, research institutions may be responsible for conducting studies, while healthcare organizations may be responsible for implementing findings.

4. Analyze stakeholder influence: Determine the level of influence each stakeholder has on international cancer research. This can be done by assessing their resources, capabilities, and the extent of their involvement in the field.

5. Identify stakeholder interests: Understand the interests and goals of each stakeholder. This can be done by reviewing their mission statements, strategic plans, or other relevant documents.

6. Determine stakeholder relationships: Identify the relationships between different stakeholders. This can help to understand the dynamics of the field and how different stakeholders interact with each other.

7. Identify gaps in stakeholder involvement: Based on the information gathered, identify any gaps in stakeholder involvement. This could include stakeholders who are not currently involved but could potentially contribute to the field, or areas where the involvement of current stakeholders could be improved.

8. Develop a stakeholder map: Create a visual representation of the stakeholders, their relationships, and their influence. This can help to better understand the landscape of international cancer research.

9. Review and refine: Regularly review and update the stakeholder identification process as new information becomes available or as the field evolves.

10. Document findings: Finally, document all findings in a comprehensive report, detailing the key stakeholders in international cancer research, their roles, interests, influence, relationships, and any identified gaps. This report can then be used to inform future strategies and policies.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Organize a brainstorming session with your team to generate innovative ideas and strategies for strengthening international cooperation in cancer research

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Identify the Team: Identify the team members who will participate in the brainstorming session. This should include representatives from all key stakeholders identified in the previous task, such as research institutions, healthcare organizations, governments, and nonprofit organizations.

2. Set the Agenda: Create an agenda for the brainstorming session. The main objective should be to generate innovative ideas and strategies for strengthening international cooperation in cancer research.

3. Prepare the Materials: Prepare all necessary materials for the brainstorming session. This could include a whiteboard or flip chart for writing down ideas, sticky notes for individual brainstorming, and any relevant data or research on the current state of international cooperation in cancer research.

4. Set the Ground Rules: Before the brainstorming session begins, set some ground rules. These could include encouraging all ideas, no matter how out-of-the-box they may seem, and ensuring that all participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.

5. Warm-Up Activity: Start the session with a warm-up activity to get everyone's creative juices flowing. This could be a quick game or a simple question related to the topic at hand.

6. Idea Generation: Begin the main part of the session by asking participants to share their ideas for strengthening international cooperation in cancer research. Write down all ideas on the whiteboard or flip chart.

7. Group Discussion: Once all ideas have been shared, facilitate a group discussion. Encourage participants to build on each other's ideas and to think critically about how these ideas could be implemented.

8. Prioritize Ideas: After the discussion, ask participants to vote on which ideas they think are the most promising. This will help prioritize which ideas to pursue further.

9. Action Plan: Based on the prioritized ideas, create an action plan. This should include next steps, responsibilities, and a timeline for implementation.

10. Follow-Up: After the brainstorming session, send a follow-up email to all participants thanking them for their time and sharing the results of the session, including the action plan. This will ensure everyone is on the same page and knows what to expect moving forward. 

11. Regular Check-Ins: Schedule regular check-ins to monitor the progress of the action plan and make any necessary adjustments. This will help keep the project on track and ensure that the innovative ideas generated during the brainstorming session are being effectively implemented.
