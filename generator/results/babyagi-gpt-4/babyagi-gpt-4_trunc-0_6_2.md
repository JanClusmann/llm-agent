Summary: 
The AI model suggested a step-by-step approach to develop a program aimed at improving the quality of life for cancer survivors. Initially, analysis of the detailed profile of the target group is carried out, focusing on demographic information, types of cancer, and specific quality of life issues. It then encourages to identify key issues affecting the group, and to use innovative thinking to brainstorm potential solutions. A research strategy is developed to explore these solutions. After drafting and revising a policy addressing the identified issues, the draft is shared with a small group of survivors and healthcare professionals for feedback. Once all revisions are done the policy is finalized for implementation. The program includes designing a plan for implementation and monitoring its effectiveness after deployment, adjusting as necessary.
