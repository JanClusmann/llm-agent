*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the scope of the policy by defining the specific areas of cancer research that the policy will cover and the countries or regions that will be involved in the cooperation

*****TASK RESULT*****

Step 1: Identify the Purpose of the Policy
Start by defining the main objective of the policy. This could be to enhance collaboration in cancer research, share knowledge and resources, or improve cancer treatment and prevention strategies globally.

Step 2: Define the Areas of Cancer Research
Identify the specific areas of cancer research that the policy will cover. This could include basic research (understanding the biology of cancer), clinical research (developing and testing new treatments), epidemiological research (studying cancer patterns in populations), or translational research (applying laboratory findings to clinical practice).

Step 3: Identify the Scope of the Policy
Determine the scope of the policy in terms of the types of cancer it will cover. This could be all types of cancer or specific types that are of particular concern globally, such as lung, breast, or colorectal cancer.

Step 4: Identify the Countries or Regions
Identify the countries or regions that will be involved in the cooperation. This could be based on factors such as the prevalence of certain types of cancer, the level of existing cancer research, or the availability of resources for research.

Step 5: Consider the Level of Development of the Countries
Consider the level of development of the countries or regions involved. The policy may need to address different challenges in high-income countries (such as the need for advanced research facilities) compared to low- and middle-income countries (such as the need for basic infrastructure and training).

Step 6: Identify Key Stakeholders
Identify the key stakeholders who will be involved in implementing the policy. This could include government agencies, research institutions, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and pharmaceutical companies.

Step 7: Define the Roles and Responsibilities of the Stakeholders
Define the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder in implementing the policy. This could include coordinating research efforts, sharing data and resources, providing funding, or advocating for policy support.

Step 8: Consider Potential Challenges and Solutions
Consider potential challenges to international cooperation in cancer research, such as differences in regulations, ethical standards, or research priorities, and identify strategies to address these challenges.

Step 9: Review and Refine the Scope of the Policy
Review the scope of the policy to ensure it is comprehensive and feasible, and refine it as necessary based on feedback from stakeholders or further analysis.
