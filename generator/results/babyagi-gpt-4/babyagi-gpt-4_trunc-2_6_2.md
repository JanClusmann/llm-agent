## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggested developing a comprehensive questionnaire to gather detailed information about the quality of life issues faced by cancer survivors, focusing on aspects like physical health, mental health, social relationships, and financial stability. The model further proposed a strategy to extend the creation, review, and revision of the questionnaire to encompass a broader scope of task management, including tracking task progress, recruiting and training volunteers, ensuring the confidentiality of respondents, and maintaining ongoing communication with stakeholders. Moreover, the AI model identified the need to develop a research strategy that would allow for a deeper exploration of certain emerging areas requiring further investigation, proposing the use of surveys, interviews, or focus groups. Finally, it proposed several considerations for the framework of this research strategy, among them the dissemination of findings, the confidentiality of participants, the acquisition of additional resources, and the integration of findings into existing programs.
