Summary: 
The AI model proposed a comprehensive guideline to shape a policy or research strategy aimed at strengthening international cooperation in cancer research. The approach started with identifying the scope of the policy, including the focal areas of cancer research and the nations involved. It then pushed for an in-depth literature review to study existing policies, identifying their strengths and weaknesses to shape the new policy. The AI emphasized the consultation with key stakeholders in cancer research, healthcare, policy making, and patient advocacy, aiming to incorporate their feedback designing the strategy. The model outlined the policy, incorporating the stakeholders' roles and responsibilities. It further stressed the significance of reviewing and revising the draft policy until it's clear, comprehensive, and feasible. The model advised implementing the policy by developing a layout, with specific timelines and milestones, and communicating it to all relevant stakeholders. The policy's effectiveness is to be regularly evaluated and adjustments are to be made as and when needed.

Main Ideas: 
- The importance of identifying the scope of the policy, particular areas in cancer research, and concerned nations.
- Scope for stakeholder consultation during the policy drafting and regular evaluations post-implementation.
- The policy should be clear, comprehensive, feasible, and provide scope for revisions.
- Implementation of the policy includes communication to all stakeholders and monitoring of progress towards set goals and objectives.
