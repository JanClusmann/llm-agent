Summary: 
The AI model suggested to develop a comprehensive training program for oncology health workers. The training program initiates with a pre-training survey to gauge the current knowledge and skills of the primary care physicians in cancer detection and referral. Then, the proposed strategy includes the development of systems for various educational aspects such as tracking attendance, providing physicians with additional reading materials, regular updates on the training schedule, and a platform for physicians to discuss their thoughts and experiences. Expert speakers like oncologists, researchers, or experienced primary care physicians would be invited to deliver lectures on specific topics. Progress of each physician would be carefully tracked through the program, and the feedback received would be used to regularly update and improve the training content.

Main Ideas: 
- Implementation of a pre-training survey to understand the existing knowledge base of the healthcare workers.
- Creating multiple platforms for varied activities like attendance tracking, discussion forums, and material distribution.
- Inviting experienced speakers for delivering specialized lectures.
- Continuous monitoring of physicians' progress throughout the program and refining the content based on feedback.
