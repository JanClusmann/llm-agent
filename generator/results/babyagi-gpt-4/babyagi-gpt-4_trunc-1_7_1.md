Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive plan to reinforce international cooperation in cancer research. The first step introduced was a profound literature review to gain foundational knowledge about the current state of international cooperation in this field. This paves the way for identifying and understanding key stakeholders; their roles, interests, influences, and relationships. To get innovative ideas, the model proposed having a brainstorming session involving team members from the key stakeholders. This could foster new strategies and approaches for future implementations. Lastly, a set of tasks was conceived to ensure proper planning and implementation of the policy or strategy, such as identifying potential funding sources, developing a budget plan, recognizing potential barriers, formulating plans to mitigate risks, and outlining regular evaluations to track the policy's progress.
