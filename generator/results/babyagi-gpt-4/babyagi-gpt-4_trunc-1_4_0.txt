*****OBJECTIVE*****

Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources.

Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Research recent technological advances in the medical field particularly those related to cancer care

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Identify the Scope of Research: Define the specific areas of cancer care you want to focus on. This could include diagnosis, treatment, patient care, etc.

2. Gather Resources: Collect relevant medical journals, articles, and books that discuss recent technological advances in cancer care. Remember, the task requires not to rely on external internet resources, so focus on offline resources like libraries, medical institutions, etc.

3. Read and Analyze: Start reading the collected resources. Look for information about new technologies, their applications in cancer care, and their effectiveness. 

4. Take Notes: As you read, take detailed notes. Write down the name of the technology, how it works, its application in cancer care, and any other relevant information.

5. Identify Key Technologies: From your notes, identify the technologies that seem to have the most significant impact on cancer care. 

6. Deep Dive: For each key technology, do a more in-depth study. Look for more resources that discuss these technologies, read about them, and take notes.

7. Compare and Contrast: Compare the new technologies with the current ones. Look at their advantages, disadvantages, and their potential to overcome the current limitations in personalized cancer care.

8. Organize Information: Organize your findings in a clear and logical manner. You can categorize them based on the type of technology, its application, etc.

9. Write a Summary: Write a detailed summary of your findings. Discuss each technology, its application in cancer care, and how it can overcome the current limitations.

10. Review and Refine: Review your work. Check for any missing information or errors. Refine your summary to ensure it is clear, concise, and informative.

11. Prepare a Presentation: If needed, prepare a presentation of your findings. Use visuals to help explain the technologies and their applications.

12. Stay Updated: Medical technology is a rapidly changing field. Make a plan to regularly review new resources and stay updated on the latest advances in cancer care technology.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the recent technological advances in personalized cancer care that have not been included in the proposal

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the proposal: Start by thoroughly reviewing the proposal to understand what technological advances in personalized cancer care have already been included. 

2. List down the included technologies: Make a list of all the technologies that have been mentioned in the proposal. This will help you keep track of what has already been included.

3. Recall your research: Reflect on the research you have done on recent technological advances in the medical field, particularly those related to cancer care. 

4. Identify the missing technologies: Compare your research findings with the list of technologies included in the proposal. Identify any recent technological advances in personalized cancer care that have not been included in the proposal.

5. Categorize the missing technologies: Group the missing technologies based on their application in personalized cancer care such as diagnosis, treatment, patient monitoring, etc. 

6. Evaluate the relevance: For each missing technology, evaluate its relevance and potential impact on personalized cancer care. Consider factors like its effectiveness, cost, accessibility, and any potential side effects or risks.

7. Prioritize the missing technologies: Based on your evaluation, prioritize the missing technologies. Technologies that could have a significant impact on improving personalized cancer care should be given higher priority.

8. Document the missing technologies: Create a detailed document listing all the missing technologies. For each technology, provide a brief description, its application in personalized cancer care, and why it is important.

9. Review the document: Review the document to ensure that all information is accurate and complete. Make any necessary revisions.

10. Submit the document: Submit the document to the relevant person or team for consideration. This could be the person or team responsible for developing the proposal. 

11. Follow up: After submitting the document, follow up to ensure that it has been received and reviewed. Offer to provide any additional information or clarification if needed.

****TASK CREATION AGENT RESPONSE****
