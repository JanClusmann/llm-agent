Summary: 
The AI model suggested to start reviewing a comprehensive study that identifies hazardous substances that the population is exposed to. This process must then identify different exposed population groups like age, gender, occupation, and geographical location, and then conduct preliminary research on the potential health effects of each identified hazardous substance. An overall health impact assessment strategy should be developed, with a clear plan about objectives, methodology, data collection, duration, and analysis to develop recommendations based on findings. The model also proposed strategies for reducing exposure to hazardous substances and mitigating the health effects. The strategies cover documenting the assessment, sharing it with stakeholders, implementing recommendations, and regularly updating it. The AI model also emphasizes the need to identify key stakeholders and communicate regularly with them. It recommends conducting risk assessments, prioritizing hazardous substances based on their risk level, and creating risk management plans. To ensure effectiveness, the model suggested conducting pilot tests and routine reviews.

Main Ideas: 
- Perform comprehensive analysis to identify hazardous substances and how they affect different population groups
- Create a Health Impact Assessment Plan - with tactics for data generation, analysis, and interpretation 
- Establish recommendations to decrease exposure and mitigate health effects
- Conduct regular reviews to ensure the plan remains relevant and effective
