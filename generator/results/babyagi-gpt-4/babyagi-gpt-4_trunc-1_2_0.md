The AI model suggested to effectively reduce tobacco consumption in a European country through an evidence-based approach. It emphasized the importance of detailed research and data collection on current tobacco consumption rates. The model outlined numerous steps for this research, such as identification of the country and type of tobacco product, gathering existing resources and new data via library research or contacting relevant organizations, and potentially conducting surveys. Other imperative steps in this procedure include analyzing collected data, documenting findings, and preparing a comprehensive report. To ensure sustainability, the model proposed to share the findings with stakeholders, plan future research based on any gaps found in the data, and study the impact of factors such as cultural practices, government policies, lobbying influence, and public opinion on tobacco consumption in the identified country.
