Summary: 
The AI model suggested to address the cancer risks associated with HPV and Hepatitis B infections by firstly identifying all stakeholders, the problem and the scope of it. It proposed conducting a comprehensive literature review on existing research related to these infections and the associated cancer risks. Once equipped with this knowledge, it recommended the preparation of a specific research question or policy objective and the sketching of a detailed strategy. Resources identification, timeline creation, stakeholder engagement, strategy implementation, monitoring, evaluation, result communication, and strategy revision were proposed as the following steps. Furthermore, an ongoing monitoring and evaluation process plus documentation and sharing of the learned lessons were suggested.

Main Ideas: 
- Identify the stakeholders, the problem, and conduct a literature review to understand the current state of knowledge in this field.
- Develop a clear research question or policy strategy and design a detailed approach including resource identification and timeline creation.
- Engage with the identified stakeholders and after their approval, implement the strategy as per the timeline.
- Monitor and evaluate the strategy continually, adjust it based on feedback, and communicate the results to the stakeholders and the broader community.
