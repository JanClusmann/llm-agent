*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the specific European country with high tobacco consumption

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Start by defining what is meant by "high tobacco consumption". This could be based on the number of cigarettes smoked per person per year, the percentage of the population that smokes, or another metric. 

2. Gather data on tobacco consumption in European countries. This could be done through various means such as accessing public health reports, surveys, or statistical databases. 

3. Once the data is gathered, organize it in a way that allows for easy comparison. This could be done by creating a spreadsheet or chart with the countries listed on one axis and the tobacco consumption metrics on the other.

4. Analyze the data to identify trends or patterns. Look for countries that stand out as having particularly high levels of tobacco consumption.

5. Once a country or countries have been identified as having high tobacco consumption, do further research to confirm this. This could involve looking at more detailed data, such as regional or demographic breakdowns, or reading studies or reports on tobacco use in that country.

6. After confirming the country with high tobacco consumption, document the findings. This could involve writing a report or creating a presentation that outlines the data and the process used to identify the country.

7. Finally, consider the implications of these findings. This could involve thinking about why this country has high tobacco consumption and what could be done to reduce it. This step may involve brainstorming ideas or strategies, or it could involve further research into the country's culture, policies, or public health initiatives.

****TASK CREATION AGENT RESPONSE****
