*****OBJECTIVE*****

Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources.

Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the types of wearable technology that are currently available for cancer detection and monitoring

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Start by reviewing the types of cancer identified in the previous task. This will help you understand what specific types of wearable technology you should be looking for.

2. Begin your research by looking at medical journals, healthcare publications, and technology magazines that you have access to. These resources often have articles about the latest advancements in medical technology, including wearable devices for cancer detection and monitoring.

3. Look for wearable devices that are specifically designed for the types of cancer you are focusing on. For example, if you are focusing on breast cancer, look for wearable devices that can detect changes in breast tissue.

4. Make a list of all the wearable devices you find. Include information about what type of cancer they are designed to detect or monitor, how they work, and any other relevant details.

5. Once you have a list of devices, start to analyze their effectiveness. Look for studies or reports that show how accurate these devices are at detecting or monitoring cancer.

6. Also consider the practicality of these devices. Are they comfortable to wear? Are they easy to use? Can they be worn all the time, or only for certain periods of the day?

7. Based on your research, identify the wearable devices that seem to be the most effective and practical for cancer detection and monitoring.

8. Finally, compile your findings into a report. This report should include a list of the wearable devices you identified, along with details about their effectiveness, practicality, and any other relevant information. This report will be useful for informing policy decisions about cancer detection and monitoring.
