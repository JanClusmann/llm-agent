11. Advocate for the Policy: Advocate for the policy to be adopted and implemented. This could involve presenting the policy to various stakeholders, lobbying government officials, and raising public awareness about the issue.

12. Monitor and Evaluate: If the policy is adopted, monitor its implementation and evaluate its effectiveness over time. This could involve tracking changes in tobacco consumption rates and health outcomes. 

13. Adjust the Policy: Based on the evaluation, make necessary adjustments to the policy to ensure it is effectively reducing tobacco consumption. 

14. Continue Advocacy: Continue advocating for the policy and its effective implementation. This could involve ongoing communication with government officials, public health organizations, and the public. 

15. Repeat the Process: If the policy is not effective, repeat the process to identify new solutions and propose a revised policy.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the specific European country with high tobacco consumption rates

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Start by defining what is meant by "high tobacco consumption rates". This could be the number of cigarettes smoked per person per year, the percentage of the population that smokes, or some other measure. 

2. Gather data on tobacco consumption rates in various European countries. This could be done through various means such as accessing public health reports, survey data, or other relevant sources. 

3. Analyze the data to identify which countries have the highest rates of tobacco consumption. This could involve calculating averages, identifying trends, or using other statistical methods.

4. Once you have identified the countries with the highest rates, do further research to understand why these rates are so high. This could involve looking at cultural factors, government policies, economic conditions, or other relevant factors.

5. Based on your analysis, identify the specific European country with the highest tobacco consumption rates. 

6. Document your findings, including the data you used, the methods you used to analyze the data, and your conclusions. 

7. Review your findings to ensure they are accurate and reliable. This could involve checking your calculations, verifying your data sources, or seeking feedback from others.

8. Finally, consider what actions could be taken to reduce tobacco consumption in the country you identified. This could involve recommending policy changes, public health interventions, or other strategies. 

9. Share your findings and recommendations with relevant stakeholders, such as public health officials, policymakers, or the public. 

10. Monitor changes in tobacco consumption rates in the country you identified to see if your recommendations are having an impact.
