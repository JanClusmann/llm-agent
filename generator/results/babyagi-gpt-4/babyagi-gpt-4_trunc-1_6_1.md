Summary: 
The AI model suggested a holistic and multistep approach to developing programs that will support cancer patients. Initially, a profound literature review on existing policies was recommended, followed by the conduction of a survey with cancer survivors, focus group discussions with healthcare professionals and research on effective policies in other countries. Furthermore, the AI emphasized the importance of creating a detailed demographic and health profile of the target group. The suggestion also entailed identifying potential funding sources and devising a risk assessment plan, setting a feedback mechanism, and planning for effective dissemination of the results. The final steps included the continual documentation and sharing of lessons learned from the process, the identification of the key issues faced by cancer survivors affecting their quality of life and subsequent listing and evaluation of the solutions.

Main Ideas: 
- Conduct a comprehensive literature review on existing policies for cancer survivors' quality of life.
- Engage cancer survivors, healthcare professionals in surveys, focus groups, and interviews.
- Consider successful policies in other countries that enhanced the quality of life for cancer survivors.
- Identify and prioritize key issues faced by cancer survivors and brainstorm potential solutions.
