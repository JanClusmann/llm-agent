Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive approach to create a policy using wearable technology for cancer screening. The model proposed defining the policy's scope regarding specific cancer types, wearable technology types, and implementation regions. The next step encompasses a literature review on existent policies and strategies on wearables used in cancer screening. Identifying key stakeholders including healthcare providers, technology manufacturers, cancer research organizations, and patients is crucial. The model recommended creating a data collection strategy respecting privacy and data protection laws. Establishing partnerships with wearable technology manufacturers and implementation through a pilot program follows. The pilot program aims to test policy effectiveness and undergoes evaluation, acting as an essential base for any policy tweaks. Post policy finalization, the model envisaged a larger scale implementation closely monitored for complexity. Ongoing policy evaluation and required updates were also suggested.

Main Ideas: 
- Define the scope of the policy: cancer types, wearable technology and implementation regions.
- Conduct a literature review, identify stakeholders, and develop a data collection strategy.
- Establish partnerships with wearable technology manufacturers and develop a pilot program.
- Evaluate the pilot program, implement the policy on a larger scale and continuously update the policy as needed.
