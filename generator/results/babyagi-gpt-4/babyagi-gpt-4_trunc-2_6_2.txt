*****OBJECTIVE*****

Create a step-by-step task list that helps solve the given problem using introspection, creativity, new ideas, and problem-solving strategies, without relying on external internet resources.

Initial task: Propose a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country

*****NEXT TASK*****

Develop a comprehensive questionnaire to gather more detailed information from the target group

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Identify the Purpose: Clearly define the purpose of the questionnaire. The purpose is to gather more detailed information about the quality of life issues faced by cancer survivors.

2. Define the Target Group: Identify the target group for the questionnaire. In this case, the target group is cancer survivors.

3. Brainstorm Questions: Based on the literature review, brainstorm a list of potential questions that could provide more detailed information about the quality of life issues faced by cancer survivors.

4. Categorize Questions: Organize the questions into categories based on the type of information they will provide. For example, categories could include physical health, mental health, social relationships, and financial stability.

5. Draft the Questionnaire: Begin drafting the questionnaire. Start with a brief introduction that explains the purpose of the questionnaire and assures respondents of their anonymity and the confidentiality of their responses.

6. Write Questions: Write the questions in a clear, concise manner. Use a mix of open-ended and closed-ended questions to gather both quantitative and qualitative data.

7. Include Demographic Questions: Include a section for demographic questions such as age, gender, type of cancer, and length of survivorship. This will allow for a more detailed analysis of the data.

8. Review and Revise: Review the questionnaire for clarity, relevance, and length. Revise as necessary to ensure that the questionnaire is not too long and that all questions are relevant and clear.

9. Pilot Test: Conduct a pilot test of the questionnaire with a small group of cancer survivors. This will allow for any issues with the questionnaire to be identified and addressed before it is distributed to the larger target group.

10. Revise Based on Feedback: Revise the questionnaire based on the feedback received from the pilot test.

11. Finalize the Questionnaire: Finalize the questionnaire and prepare it for distribution to the target group.

12. Distribute the Questionnaire: Distribute the questionnaire to the target group using the chosen method (e.g., mail, email, in-person).

13. Collect and Analyze Data: Once the questionnaires have been completed, collect and analyze the data to gain a deeper understanding of the quality of life issues faced by cancer survivors.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Develop a research strategy to further explore these solutions which may include conducting surveys interviews or focus groups with cancer survivors

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the Comprehensive Questionnaire: Start by reviewing the comprehensive questionnaire that was previously developed. This will give you a clear understanding of the information already gathered and the areas that need further exploration.

2. Identify Key Areas for Further Research: Based on the review, identify the key areas that need further research. These could be areas where the information gathered was not sufficient or areas that have emerged as important during the review.

3. Develop a Research Strategy: Based on the identified areas, develop a research strategy. This could include conducting surveys, interviews, or focus groups with cancer survivors. The strategy should clearly outline the methods to be used, the target group, the timeline, and the expected outcomes.

4. Design Research Tools: Design the tools that will be used for the research. If you are conducting surveys, design the survey questions. If you are conducting interviews or focus groups, design the interview guide or the discussion guide.

5. Pilot Test the Research Tools: Before rolling out the research, conduct a pilot test of the research tools. This will help you identify any issues with the tools and make necessary adjustments.

6. Conduct the Research: Once the tools have been tested and adjusted, conduct the research. This could involve sending out surveys, conducting interviews, or facilitating focus groups.

7. Analyze the Data: After the research has been conducted, analyze the data. This could involve coding the data, identifying themes, and drawing conclusions.

8. Review the Findings: Review the findings from the research. This could involve comparing the findings with the information gathered from the questionnaire and identifying any new insights.

9. Develop a Report: Based on the findings, develop a report. The report should clearly outline the research process, the findings, and the conclusions.

10. Share the Report: Share the report with relevant stakeholders. This could involve presenting the report at a meeting, sending the report via email, or publishing the report on a website.

11. Plan for Further Research: Based on the findings and feedback from the stakeholders, plan for further research. This could involve refining the research strategy, designing new research tools, or identifying new areas for research.
