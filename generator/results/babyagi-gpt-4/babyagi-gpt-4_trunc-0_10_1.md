## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggested to start with a thorough analysis of the demographic data to understand which populations are most affected by HPV and Hepatitis B infections. Key issues contributing to these high rates, such as lack of awareness or access to healthcare, should be identified. A literature review should be conducted to grasp the current state of research and policies; any gaps recognized could hint at potential solutions. These solutions could then be developed into a detailed research or policy proposal. An important part of this process is the inclusion of experts' feedback, which could lead to adjustments of the proposal. A pilot test could evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal before implementation on a larger scale. Following implementation, the results should be evaluated and any necessary adjustments made. The findings should then be shared with key stakeholders. Ultimately, these findings could be used to lobby for substantial changes, such as altering policies or advocating for increased research funding.

Main Ideas:
