Summary: 
The AI model suggested a systematic approach to reduce exposure to hazardous substances. The approach entails identifying the substances, determining their sources and their effects on the population. It further includes identifying stakeholders such as government agencies, environmental organizations, industries, and communities affected. The model highlights the importance of an extensive risk assessment, focusing on both immediate and long-term effects. It expressed the need for a comprehensive research strategy to gather more information about the problem. Suggestions on brainstorming potential solutions, assessing feasibility, and developing a policy proposal based on the research were also made. The implementation process, if the policy is approved, involves coordinating with various agencies, training provision, and resource allocation. The AI underlines the importance of monitoring and evaluation, making necessary policy adjustments. The regular review and update of the policy were deemed essential to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance.

Main Ideas: 
- Identify the hazardous substance, it sources, the affected population and stakeholder groups to establish a clear understanding of the issues.
- Execute an environmental and health risk assessment to comprehend the potential impacts and regions at risk, and to develop a comprehensive research strategy.
- Brainstorm solutions, assess feasibility and effectiveness, and form a policy proposal based on the gathered data and evaluations.
- Once the policy is approved, administer the application accordingly and establish a monitoring system to constantly evaluate and adjust the policy when necessary.
