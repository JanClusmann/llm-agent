*****NEXT TASK*****

You are tasked to develop a policy or research strategy to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the Existing Curriculum: Start by reviewing the curriculum that has been developed on early cancer detection and referral. Understand the key points, the theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and case studies that have been included. 

2. Identify the Needs of Cancer Survivors: Use introspection and creativity to identify the needs of cancer survivors. This could include physical needs, emotional needs, social needs, and financial needs. 

3. Conduct a Literature Review: Review existing literature on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Look for research papers, articles, and books that discuss this topic. This will help you understand the current state of research and identify gaps in the literature.

4. Develop a Research Question: Based on your understanding of the needs of cancer survivors and the existing literature, develop a research question. This question should aim to address a gap in the literature and contribute to improving the quality of life of cancer survivors.

5. Design a Research Strategy: Design a research strategy to answer your research question. This could involve conducting surveys, interviews, or focus groups with cancer survivors. It could also involve analyzing existing data.

6. Develop a Policy Proposal: Based on your research findings, develop a policy proposal that aims to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. This could involve proposing changes to healthcare policies, social policies, or financial policies.

7. Test the Policy Proposal: Test the policy proposal by conducting a pilot study or a small-scale implementation. Gather feedback from cancer survivors and other stakeholders to understand the effectiveness of the policy.

8. Refine the Policy Proposal: Based on the feedback received, refine the policy proposal. Make necessary changes to ensure that the policy is effective in improving the quality of life of cancer survivors.

9. Implement the Policy: Once the policy proposal has been refined, implement it on a larger scale. Monitor the implementation to ensure that it is being carried out as planned.

10. Evaluate the Policy: After the policy has been implemented, evaluate its effectiveness. This could involve conducting follow-up surveys or interviews with cancer survivors, or analyzing data on the quality of life of cancer survivors.

11. Make Necessary Adjustments: Based on the evaluation, make necessary adjustments to the policy. This could involve making changes to the policy itself, or to the way it is implemented.

12. Document the Process: Document the entire process, from the development of the research question to the evaluation of the policy. This documentation can be used for future reference, or to share your findings with others.
