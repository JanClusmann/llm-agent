*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope of your literature review. This should include the types of cancer you are focusing on, the specific aspects of quality of life you are interested in, and the geographical regions you are considering.

2. Identify Relevant Databases: Identify the databases that are most likely to contain relevant literature. These could include medical databases like PubMed, social science databases like JSTOR, and policy databases like PolicyFile.

3. Develop Search Terms: Develop a list of search terms related to your topic. These could include "cancer survivors," "quality of life," "policy," "strategy," and any other terms that are relevant to your scope.

4. Conduct Searches: Use your search terms to conduct searches in your identified databases. Be sure to record the details of each search, including the database, the search terms used, and the number of results.

5. Screen Titles and Abstracts: Review the titles and abstracts of the articles you find to determine if they are relevant to your topic. Exclude any articles that are not relevant.

6. Full-Text Review: For the articles that pass the title and abstract screening, conduct a full-text review to determine if they contain useful information for your literature review.

7. Extract Relevant Information: For each article that passes the full-text review, extract the relevant information. This could include the type of policy or strategy, its effectiveness at improving quality of life, and any other relevant details.

8. Analyze and Synthesize Information: Analyze the information you have extracted to identify trends, gaps, and areas of disagreement. Synthesize this information into a coherent narrative that addresses your research question.

9. Write the Literature Review: Write your literature review, ensuring that you clearly present the information you have found, your analysis of this information, and how it relates to your research question.

10. Review and Edit: Review your literature review for clarity, coherence, and accuracy. Make any necessary edits.

11. Cite Sources: Ensure that all sources are properly cited according to the appropriate citation style.

12. Finalize the Review: After all edits and revisions are made, finalize your literature review. This could involve submitting it to a supervisor or publishing it in a relevant journal.

*****NEXT TASK*****

Identify the key issues that cancer survivors face which affect their quality of life such as physical health issues mental health issues and financial difficulties

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Review the Literature: Start by reviewing the literature you have already gathered on existing policies or strategies aimed at improving the quality of life for cancer survivors. Look for common themes or issues that are frequently mentioned.

2. Identify Physical Health Issues: Make a list of the physical health issues that cancer survivors often face. This could include things like fatigue, pain, long-term side effects of treatment, and secondary health conditions caused by cancer or its treatment.

3. Identify Mental Health Issues: Next, make a list of the mental health issues that cancer survivors often face. This could include things like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and cognitive difficulties.

4. Identify Financial Difficulties: Finally, make a list of the financial difficulties that cancer survivors often face. This could include things like medical debt, loss of income due to inability to work, and the cost of ongoing medical care.

5. Prioritize the Issues: Once you have a comprehensive list of issues, prioritize them based on how frequently they are mentioned in the literature, how severe they are, and how much they impact a person's quality of life.

6. Brainstorm Solutions: For each issue, brainstorm potential solutions. These could be things like policy changes, new treatment strategies, or support services for cancer survivors.

7. Evaluate the Solutions: Evaluate each solution based on its feasibility, potential impact, and how well it addresses the issue it is meant to solve.

8. Create a Plan: Based on your evaluation, create a plan for addressing the key issues that cancer survivors face. This plan should include specific steps for implementing each solution, as well as a timeline and measures for evaluating success.

9. Review and Refine the Plan: Finally, review the plan and refine it as necessary. This could involve getting feedback from others, testing out some of the solutions, or doing additional research to fill in any gaps. 

10. Implement the Plan: Once you are satisfied with the plan, begin implementing it. Monitor progress and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that the plan is effectively addressing the key issues that cancer survivors face.
