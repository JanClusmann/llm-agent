Summary: 
The AI model suggested to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research by developing a policy grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the field. The first step proposed is defining the scope of the policy, reviewing its specific aims within the areas of cancer research as well as identifying the regions or countries to be involved. This would be followed by a brainstorming session to find potential objectives and goals for the policy. After narrowing down these ideas and defining SMART goals within categorized areas of research, a feedback process with key stakeholders would take place. Furthermore, the AI model emphasized the significance of setting up a mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of the policy's implementation. The review of literature on existing policies was also recommended, notably identifying the themes, gaps and potential barriers based on findings from the literature reviews. The execution of these plans with defined resources, potential partners, a timeline, and proper recognition and reward system for the involved stakeholders was also discussed.

Main Ideas: 
- Define the scope, potential goals, and strategies of the policy by having insightful discussions and brainstorming sessions. 
- Create measurable, concrete goals and objectives for the policy, shaped by feedback from various stakeholders.
- Develop an evaluation and monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of the policy.
- Perform an extensive literature review on existing policies to identify the themes, gaps, and potential barriers to implementation of the new policy.
