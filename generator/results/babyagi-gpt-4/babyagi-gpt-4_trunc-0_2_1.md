Summary: 
The AI model suggested a detailed stepwise policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country. The process begins by determining the country with high tobacco consumption using gathered data on rates and demographics. Potential solutions like increasing tobacco taxes, stricter advertising regulations, smoking cessation programs, and public health campaigns would be brainstormed. The data collected and brainstormed solutions would be used to draft a policy proposal, which would undergo further reviews for potential improvements. This proposal would then be subjected to feedback from stakeholders, revised, and finally presented to relevant government bodies. Advocacy for the policy's adoption and implementation would then begin, after which the policy would be monitored for effectiveness, with necessary periodic adjustments. The process could be repeated if the policy proves ineffective.

Main Ideas: 
- Identification of the European country with high tobacco consumption rates.
- Development of a policy proposal based on research and data analysis.
- Advocacy for policy adoption and implementation to relevant stakeholders. 
- Monitoring and evaluation of the policy's effectiveness with adjustments as necessary.
