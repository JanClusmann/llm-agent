6. Seek Feedback: Share the draft policy or research strategy with stakeholders and seek their feedback. This could involve meetings, workshops, or public consultations.

7. Revise the Policy or Research Strategy: Based on the feedback received, revise the policy or research strategy as necessary. This could involve refining the goals, adjusting the strategies, or modifying the evaluation measures.

8. Finalize the Policy or Research Strategy: Once all revisions have been made, finalize the policy or research strategy. This should include a clear implementation plan and timeline.

9. Implement the Policy or Research Strategy: Begin implementing the policy or research strategy according to the plan and timeline. This could involve training healthcare professionals, launching educational campaigns, or starting vaccination programs.

10. Monitor and Evaluate: Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the policy or research strategy. This could involve collecting data on HPV and Hepatitis B infection rates, cancer incidence, and vaccination rates.

11. Adjust as Necessary: Based on the evaluation results, adjust the policy or research strategy as necessary. This could involve modifying the implementation plan, refining the strategies, or revising the goals. 

12. Document and Share Results: Document the process and results of the policy or research strategy. Share these findings with stakeholders and the wider community to promote transparency and encourage further research and policy development.
