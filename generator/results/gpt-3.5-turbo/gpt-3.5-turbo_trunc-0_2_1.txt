Title: Comprehensive Tobacco Control Policy to Reduce Tobacco Consumption in [European Country]

Introduction:
This proposal outlines a comprehensive tobacco control policy aiming to reduce tobacco consumption and prevent the associated health risks in [European Country]. Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable deaths and diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, and various forms of cancer. Implementing evidence-based measures, this policy intends to curb tobacco consumption, protect public health, and promote a smoke-free environment.

1. Strengthen Tobacco Control Laws:
a. Increase the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products to 21 years.
b. Enforce strict restrictions on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, including a total ban on tobacco advertising in all media platforms.
c. Implement plain packaging measures that eliminate branding and use graphic warnings covering a significant portion of the cigarette packaging.

2. Taxation and Price Measures:
a. Gradually increase excise taxes on tobacco products to reduce affordability and discourage consumption.
b. Introduce a minimum price for tobacco products to prevent the sale of heavily discounted cigarettes and discourage price-seeking behavior.

3. Comprehensive Smoking Ban:
a. Extend the existing smoking ban to include all enclosed public places, workplaces, restaurants, bars, and outdoor areas, such as parks, playgrounds, and sports stadiums.
b. Prohibit smoking within a specific distance from public entrances, ensuring a smoke-free environment for everyone.

4. Evidence-based Cessation Programs:
a. Establish a national smoking cessation helpline and online resources, providing free access to counseling, medication, and support materials.
b. Integrate smoking cessation services within healthcare facilities, including primary care settings, hospitals, and mental health facilities.
c. Mandate healthcare professionals to screen and provide brief interventions on tobacco use during routine visits.

5. Public Awareness Campaigns:
a. Launch sustained public awareness campaigns highlighting the health risks associated with tobacco use, targeting both current and potential users.
b. Educate the public about available cessation services, emphasizing the benefits of quitting and providing information on resources to support quitting attempts.

6. Monitoring and Evaluation:
a. Establish a dedicated tobacco control surveillance system to monitor the implementation and impact of the policy measures.
b. Conduct regular studies and surveys to evaluate changes in tobacco consumption rates, awareness levels, and smoking-related health outcomes.

7. Collaboration and International Engagement:
a. Foster collaboration with international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Network for Smoking and Tobacco Prevention (ENSP), to exchange best practices, access expertise, and enhance policy implementation.
b. Participate actively in international agreements, such as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) to align with global commitments.

Conclusion:
This proposed comprehensive tobacco control policy in [European Country] combines legislative measures, price interventions, smoking bans, cessation support, public awareness campaigns, and monitoring mechanisms. By implementing these evidence-based strategies, the country can significantly reduce tobacco consumption, protect public health, and ensure a healthier future for its citizens.
