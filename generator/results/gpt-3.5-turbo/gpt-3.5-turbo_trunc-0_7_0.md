Summary: 
The AI model proposed a hypothetical strategy to bolster international cooperation in cancer research. It focuses on promoting data sharing, standardizing methods, strengthening capacities, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks. It further emphasizes the need for inter-country partnerships and the development of a global repository to improve knowledge management and research outcomes.

Main Ideas: 
- Advocate for data standardization and sharing globally, respecting data privacy and security norms. 
- Encourage academic and research collaborations globally, supported by appropriate funding mechanisms. 
- Strengthen research capacity in low- and middle-income countries via training, mentorship, and collaboration with well-established research entities.

Main Finding: 
- Developing harmonized regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines could fast-track the availability of promising treatments.
- Establishing international consortia could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of cancer.
- Creating a global repository would allow for widespread dissemination of research outcomes, training materials, and knowledge exchange.
