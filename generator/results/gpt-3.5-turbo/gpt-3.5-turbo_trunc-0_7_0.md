Summary: 
The AI model suggested a policy intended to fortify international cooperation in cancer research, acknowledging the global nature of cancer as a health challenge. The policy proposed encouraging data sharing and standardization, where nations develop common exchange protocols and ensure data security. The establishment of collaborative partnerships between research organizations globally, supported by funding mechanisms, was also suggested. The model also proposed the harmonization of regulatory frameworks and mutual recognition of regulations across nations to expedite the availability of treatments. Strengthening research capabilities in low and middle-income countries was emphasized, by providing technical assistance and fostering collaboration with high-income countries. Further, the strategy entailed the establishment of an international research group, promotion of translational research and clinical trials, enlarging preventive measures, early detection and screening, and strengthening information management.

Main Ideas: 
- Promote data sharing, standardization, and ensure data security across global research institutions.
- Encourage international collaborations, partnerships and establish funding mechanisms for joint research projects.
- Foster regulatory harmonization and mutual recognition to fast-track the rollout of treatments.
- Strengthening research abilities in low and middle-income countries, and support global inclusion in clinical trials.
