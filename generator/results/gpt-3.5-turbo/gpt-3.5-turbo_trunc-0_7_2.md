Summary: 
The AI model suggested to establish an international cooperative approach towards battling cancer. It proposed to establish a global cancer research network that would include researchers, medical professionals, policymakers, and funding agencies. The model further encouraged public-private partnerships and strengthening regional corporations through joint research programs and harmonization of regulatory frameworks. Harmonizing research standards was another suggestion provided, which would entail creating standardized research protocols, promoting research ethics, and establishing oversight mechanisms. The creation of global cancer data repositories and facilitating the transfer of advanced technologies were some measures in the technology area. The structural part of the system was addressed by advocating for increasing funding and ensuring equitable resource allocation. Lastly, the model proposed promoting open-access publishing and enhancing science communication to communicate the findings.

Main Ideas: 
- Establish a globally inclusive network for knowledge sharing and data exchange.
- Facilitate public-private partnerships and strengthen regional corporations.
- Advocate for common research protocols, ethical guidelines, and oversight mechanisms.
- Implement a structure advocating for increased funding and equitable allocation of resources and promote open-access publishing and enhanced science communication.
