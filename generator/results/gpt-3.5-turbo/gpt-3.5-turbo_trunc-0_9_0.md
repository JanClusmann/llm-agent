Summary: 
The AI model suggested implementing a multifaceted policy and research strategy aimed at reducing population exposure to hazardous substances. The outline provided by the AI includes six major components: enhancement of the regulatory framework, promotion of alternatives and substitution, consumer education and awareness, monitoring and research, international cooperation and data sharing, as well as continuous evaluation and improvement. To bolster its approach, the AI model recommended close collaboration with a variety of stakeholders including government bodies, research institutions, industry representatives, healthcare professionals, and the general public. The AI model also proposed channeling funding from different sources, both national and international, or through public-private partnerships for research, educational campaigns, and other associated initiatives.

Main Ideas: 
- Enhance the regulatory framework encompassing production, usage, and disposal of hazardous substances.
- Promote safer alternatives to hazardous substances by funding research and providing incentives to businesses.
- Educate the public about hazardous substances, how to minimize exposure, and the importance of proper disposal and recycling.
- Encourage international cooperation and data sharing, especially with countries that are major producers or users of hazardous substances.
