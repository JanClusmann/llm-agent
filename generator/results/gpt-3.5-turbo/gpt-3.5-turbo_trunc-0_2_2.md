Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country. The proposed measures include strengthening tobacco control laws and regulations; launching public awareness and education campaigns; promoting smoking cessation programs and services; increasing taxes and prices on tobacco products; enhancing law enforcement and monitoring; supporting research and surveillance on tobacco-related areas; and collaborating with international tobacco control organizations. The AI model proposed enhancing existing tobacco legislation to put comprehensive ban on smoking in public areas, and extending bans on tobacco advertising in all media formats, with proposed rigorous health warnings on cigarette packs. The policy also advocated for higher taxes on tobacco products with the extra revenue funneled towards public healthcare and tobacco control initiatives. The model emphasized regular evaluations and reviews to assess the effectiveness of implemented measures, suggesting alterations where required, based on the data related to tobacco consumption rates and public perception on tobacco control measures.
