Summary: 
The AI model suggested to integrate various technological advancements to personalize cancer care, aiming to provide each patient with treatments that suit their unique genetic and clinical profile. It proposed the integration of genomic profiling to optimize a therapy's effectiveness based on an individual's genetic makeup, and the use of AI in decision support systems to help in treatment selection and response prediction. The model also recommended the use of telemedicine and remote monitoring to improve patient access to care and continuity of treatment, and the introduction of VR technologies for psychological support and well-being. Moreover, the implementation of big data and machine learning in clinical trials was suggested to enable efficient patient stratification and the acceleration of targeted therapies development. The model proposed the use of patient engagement platforms to facilitate self-management and adherence to treatment plans. Finally, it recommended adopting robotic surgery and precision interventional radiology techniques for minimally invasive tumor removal providing a better overall treatment experience.
