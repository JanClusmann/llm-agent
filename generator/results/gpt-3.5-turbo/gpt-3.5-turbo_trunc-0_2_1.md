These include the promotion of public awareness and education through nationwide campaigns and curricular inclusions; the tightening of tobacco advertising regulation; a significant increase in tobacco prices; the expansion of smoke-free policies within all public spaces; providing accessible and affordable smoking cessation services; reinforcement of enforcement and penalties for violators; allocation of funds for research and evaluation to measure the effectiveness of these policies; and fostering collaborations with international organizations, neighboring countries, and global health bodies to share and learn from successful tobacco control strategies.
