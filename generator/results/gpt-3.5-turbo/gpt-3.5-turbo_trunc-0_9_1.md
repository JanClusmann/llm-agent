Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive approach to reduce exposure to hazardous substances, which includes creating a multidisciplinary expert panel to provide guidance based on the latest evidence and research findings, conducting research to identify and prioritize hazardous substances, enhancing toxicological research, and developing exposure assessment methodologies. Updating existing regulatory frameworks and developing stricter controls, promoting research into alternate safe substances, implementing education and awareness campaigns, and improving industrial safety was also suggested. It emphasized the need for international collaboration for knowledge exchange related to reducing exposure to hazardous substances. The model also suggested setting up a monitoring and evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of interventions implemented to reduce exposure.

Main Ideas: 
- Establish an expert panel comprising professionals from diverse fields like public health, toxicology, environmental science, and policy-making.
- Update regulatory frameworks, develop stricter standards, and promote research into safer alternative substances. 
- Implement education and awareness campaigns about hazardous substances and enhance occupational safety. 
- Foster international collaboration, and establish a system to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of the implemented interventions.
