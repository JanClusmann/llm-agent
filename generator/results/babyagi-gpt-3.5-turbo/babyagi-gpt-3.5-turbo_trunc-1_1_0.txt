*****NEXT TASK*****

Research and gather information on the most common types of cancer and their risk factors

*****TASK RESULT*****

1. Start by brainstorming and making a list of the most common types of cancer. This can include breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, skin cancer, etc.

2. Once you have a list, prioritize the types of cancer based on their prevalence and impact. This can be done by researching statistics and data on cancer incidence and mortality rates.

3. For each type of cancer, gather information on their risk factors. Risk factors can include genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and exposure to certain substances or chemicals.

4. Research and gather information on the specific risk factors associated with each type of cancer. For example, for lung cancer, risk factors can include smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, and exposure to certain chemicals or substances like asbestos.

5. Make a comprehensive list of the risk factors for each type of cancer, including both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Modifiable risk factors are those that can be changed or controlled, such as smoking or diet, while non-modifiable risk factors are those that cannot be changed, such as age or family history.

6. Organize the information in a clear and concise manner, such as creating a table or chart, to easily compare and understand the risk factors for each type of cancer.

7. Review the gathered information and identify any patterns or commonalities among the different types of cancer. This can help in understanding the overall risk factors for cancer in general.

8. Consider any additional factors or information that may be relevant to the topic, such as emerging research or new risk factors that have been identified.

9. Finally, summarize the gathered information and create a comprehensive report or document that outlines the most common types of cancer and their associated risk factors. This report can be used for educational purposes, raising awareness, or as a reference for future research or decision-making.
