## Summary table by gpt-4
1. Improved Accessibility: The early detection program can be enhanced by increasing its accessibility. This could be achieved by setting up mobile detection units in remote areas, partnering with local healthcare facilities for shared resource usage and providing free or subsidized checks for underprivileged women.
   
2. Greater Use of AI & Advanced Technologies: Implementing advanced technology such as machine learning and AI into the detection programs for better and more accurate analysis of mammograms and other diagnostic reports. This would contribute to early detection and effective treatment of the disease.
   
3. Intensified Awareness Campaigns: Run more intensive awareness campaigns and educational programs to encourage women to participate in regular screenings, and to make them aware of the importance of early detection.

4. Training Programs for healthcare providers: More training programs could be organized for healthcare providers, focusing on the importance of early detection, the latest diagnostic techniques and patient care.

5. Tailored Program: Creating a custom program for individuals who are at a higher risk to have a detailed and routine check-up.
   
6. Partnership with private sector: Collaborating with private organizations could be a viable option to gather more funding and resources for better equipment, training and research.

7. Research and Developments: Invest more in research and development of early detection techniques and treatments to continuously update and improve the program.

8. Improved Data Management: Implement better data management and privacy systems to securely deal with patient information and to ensure the traceability and accessibility of information.

9. Community Based Approach: Adopting a community-based approach to make the program more inclusive and to reach out to a wider audience.

Overall, an integrated approach involving better accessibility, advanced technology, awareness campaigns, training for healthcare providers, partnerships with private sectors, improved data management and community-based approach can greatly enhance the effectiveness of the early detection programs for breast cancer.
