## Summary table by gpt-4
Let us consider a European country like France. The policy would incorporate three main action areas: 
   
1. Retail Regulation: This would involve limiting the number of outlets selling tobacco in a given region, based on its population to reduce accessibility. This could also include restricting the opening hours of these outlets.

2. Increase in Tax: A systematic increase in taxes on all tobacco products could be implemented. This would serve as a deterrent for consumers, making tobacco less affordable. 

3. Public Awareness Campaigns: The policy would also include funding for intensive public awareness campaigns. These campaigns would educate the public about the dangers of tobacco use as well as the benefits of quitting. They could be carried out through various social and mainstream media platforms. 

In addition, the policy could also involve stringent regulatory measures to limit tobacco advertising and the strategic placement of health warnings on tobacco products. The policy may also include stop smoking services, offering free resources and support to those who wish to quit. 

Legislation could be enacted to support these initiatives with violators facing penalties. These measures taken together could help to greatly reduce tobacco consumption.
