Output of the AI Model:

The AI proposes a threefold approach of improving public awareness, implementing stricter regulations, and providing accessible support and healthcare to combat tobacco use in a European country. The policy would consist of initiating large-scale educational campaigns to impart knowledge about the health hazards of smoking, and also dissociate social status and positive emotions linked with tobacco. Secondly, the policy would create stricter tobacco restrictions, raising prices and limiting areas where smoking is allowed, simultaneously introducing plain packaging laws and media restrictions to limit tobacco advertisement. Lastly, the plan calls for increased investment in both tobacco cessation support services like counseling, and medications, and for enhanced healthcare for those affected by smoking-related diseases.
