Output:
1. Establish International Research Collaborations: Encourage and facilitate collaborations between cancer research institutions globally. This can be achieved through joint research projects, exchange programs for researchers, and shared resources and databases.2. Standardize Research Protocols: Develop and implement standardized research protocols to ensure consistency and comparability of research findings across different countries. This will also facilitate data sharing and meta-analysis of studies.3. Promote Open Access: Advocate for open access to research findings to ensure that researchers worldwide can benefit from and build upon each other's work. This can be achieved through open access publishing and creating global databases of research findings.4. Organize International Conferences and Workshops: Regular international conferences and workshops can provide a platform for researchers to share their findings, discuss challenges, and explore potential collaborations.5. Secure Funding: Work with governments, philanthropic organizations, and private sector to secure funding for international collaborative research projects. This could also involve creating a global fund for cancer research.6. Develop Capacity: Support capacity building in low and middle-income countries to ensure they can participate in and contribute to global cancer research. This could involve training programs, infrastructure development, and technology transfer.7. Advocate for Policy Change: Advocate for policies that support international collaboration in cancer research, such as easing visa restrictions for researchers, harmonizing ethical guidelines, and promoting intellectual property rights agreements that facilitate collaboration.8. Foster Multidisciplinary Approach: Encourage a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, bringing together experts in different fields such as genetics, immunology, epidemiology, and social sciences. This can lead to more comprehensive and innovative solutions.9. Create a Global Cancer Research Network: Establish a network that connects cancer research institutions, researchers, funders, and policy makers worldwide. This network can facilitate communication, collaboration, and coordination in the global cancer research community.10. Monitor and Evaluate: Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the international cooperation strategy, and make necessary adjustments to ensure it continues to strengthen global cancer research.

Output:
1. Identify Key Stakeholders: The first step would be to identify key stakeholders in international cancer research. This would include research institutions, healthcare organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and government bodies from different countries.2. Establish a Common Goal: The next step would be to establish a common goal that all stakeholders can agree upon. This could be something like "To accelerate the development of effective cancer treatments through international cooperation."3. Develop a Framework for Collaboration: Once a common goal has been established, a framework for collaboration needs to be developed. This could involve setting up regular meetings or conferences, creating a platform for sharing research findings, and establishing guidelines for collaborative research projects.4. Encourage Data Sharing: One of the biggest challenges in international research is data sharing. Policies need to be developed that encourage data sharing while also protecting patient privacy and intellectual property rights.5. Secure Funding: International cooperation in cancer research would require significant funding. Strategies need to be developed to secure funding from various sources, including government grants, private donations, and corporate sponsorships.6. Monitor Progress: Finally, a system needs to be put in place to monitor progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the cooperation. This could involve regular reports, audits, and evaluations.7. Advocate for Policy Changes: In order to facilitate international cooperation, it may be necessary to advocate for changes in national and international policies that currently hinder cooperation.8. Promote Education and Training: Promoting education and training in cancer research can help to build capacity in countries that currently lack the resources to conduct high-quality research.9. Foster a Culture of Cooperation: Last but not least, it's important to foster a culture of cooperation among researchers. This could involve promoting the benefits of cooperation, recognizing and rewarding collaborative efforts, and providing opportunities for researchers to collaborate.
