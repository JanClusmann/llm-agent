As a medical advisor, I would suggest the following strategy:1. Education and Awareness: The first step is to educate the public about the hazardous substances, their sources, and their potential health effects. This can be done through public awareness campaigns, educational programs in schools, and information on government websites.2. Regulation and Legislation: Implement strict regulations and legislation to control the production, use, and disposal of hazardous substances. This includes setting limits for exposure levels, enforcing proper safety measures in industries, and imposing penalties for violations.3. Monitoring and Surveillance: Establish a system for regular monitoring and surveillance of hazardous substances in the environment. This will help in early detection of any increase in exposure levels and prompt action can be taken.4. Research: Invest in research to develop safer alternatives to hazardous substances. Also, research on improving methods for detection and treatment of health effects caused by these substances.5. Collaboration: Collaborate with international organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders to share knowledge and resources, and to work together towards reducing exposure to hazardous substances.6. Health Services: Strengthen health services to effectively manage and treat health conditions caused by exposure to hazardous substances. This includes training of healthcare professionals, provision of necessary equipment and medicines, and setting up specialized clinics or departments.7. Emergency Preparedness: Develop a plan for emergency situations like chemical spills or industrial accidents that may lead to sudden increase in exposure to hazardous substances. This includes evacuation plans, provision of emergency medical services, and clean-up procedures. 8. Regular Review: Regularly review and update the policy or strategy based on new research findings, changes in exposure levels, and feedback from the public and other stakeholders.

Output:
First, we need to identify the hazardous substances that the population is most exposed to. This could be done through surveys, studies, or by analyzing existing data. Second, we need to understand how the population is being exposed to these substances. Are they in the air? In the water? In certain types of food or products? Third, we need to develop strategies to reduce this exposure. This could involve regulations to limit the amount of these substances that can be released into the environment, education campaigns to inform the public about how to avoid exposure, or the development of safer alternatives to these substances.Fourth, we need to implement these strategies and monitor their effectiveness. This could involve regular testing of air, water, and food for these substances, as well as surveys or studies to assess changes in exposure levels.Finally, we need to continually review and update our strategies based on new research or changes in the population's exposure to these substances. This is a continuous process that requires ongoing commitment and resources. In terms of research, we should focus on understanding the health effects of these substances, developing safer alternatives, and identifying the most effective ways to reduce exposure. This could involve laboratory studies, epidemiological studies, and social science research.
