Output:
One policy to reduce tobacco consumption in a specific European country could be the implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control program. This program could include the following measures:1. Increase Taxes: Increase taxes on tobacco products. Higher prices for tobacco products can deter people from starting to smoke, encourage current smokers to quit, and reduce the quantity of tobacco consumed by smokers.2. Smoke-Free Public Places: Implement laws that prohibit smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces, including restaurants and bars. This not only protects non-smokers from secondhand smoke but also creates an environment where smoking is not a social norm.3. Advertising Ban: Enforce a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship. This includes a ban on point-of-sale advertising and display of tobacco products.4. Graphic Health Warnings: Mandate graphic health warnings on all tobacco packaging. These warnings should cover at least 75% of the front and back of the package and should be rotated regularly.5. Cessation Support: Provide accessible and affordable support for smokers who want to quit. This could include quitlines, mobile text messaging services, and access to nicotine replacement therapy and other cessation medications.6. Public Education: Conduct mass media campaigns to educate the public about the harms of smoking and the benefits of quitting. These campaigns should be sustained over time to reach a large audience.7. Restrict Sale: Restrict the sale of tobacco products to minors. This can be enforced by requiring photo identification for purchase and penalizing retailers who sell to minors.8. Plain Packaging: Implement plain packaging laws to remove all branding and make all cigarette packs look the same, except for the health warnings. This can reduce the appeal of tobacco products, especially among young people.By implementing these measures, the specific European country can significantly reduce tobacco consumption and improve public health.

Output:
First, we could implement a comprehensive ban on all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship. This includes indirect advertising through other products or events, as well as cross-border advertising from neighboring countries.Second, we could increase taxes on tobacco products. Higher prices for tobacco products can reduce demand, particularly among young people and low-income individuals.Third, we could introduce and enforce legislation for smoke-free environments in all indoor public places, workplaces, and on public transportation. This not only protects non-smokers from second-hand smoke, but also creates an environment that encourages smokers to quit or reduce their consumption.Fourth, we could implement mandatory graphic health warnings on all tobacco packaging. These warnings should cover at least 50% of the principal display areas and depict the harmful effects of tobacco use.Fifth, we could provide accessible and affordable treatment for tobacco dependence. This includes counseling services and medication, which should be available as part of the country's health care system.Lastly, we could launch public awareness campaigns about the dangers of tobacco use and the benefits of quitting. These campaigns should target all segments of the population, with special focus on vulnerable groups such as youth and low-income individuals. These measures, if implemented together, can significantly reduce tobacco consumption in the country.
