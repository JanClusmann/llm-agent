As a medical advisor, I would suggest the following steps to develop a policy or research strategy to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances:1. Identify the Hazardous Substances: The first step is to identify the hazardous substances that people are most commonly exposed to. This could be done through surveys, research, and data analysis.2. Understand the Exposure Pathways: Understand how people are getting exposed to these substances. This could be through air, water, food, or direct contact.3. Develop Guidelines: Develop guidelines on safe levels of exposure and methods to reduce exposure. This could include guidelines on personal protective equipment, safe handling procedures, and waste disposal.4. Education and Awareness: Conduct awareness campaigns to educate the public about the risks associated with these substances and how to protect themselves.5. Legislation and Regulation: Work with lawmakers to develop legislation and regulations that limit the use of these substances and ensure that they are properly handled and disposed of.6. Research: Conduct ongoing research to understand the long-term effects of exposure to these substances and to develop new methods of reducing exposure and mitigating the effects.7. Monitoring and Evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the policy or strategy and make necessary adjustments.8. Collaboration: Collaborate with other stakeholders such as health organizations, environmental agencies, and community groups to implement the policy or strategy effectively. 9. Emergency Preparedness: Develop a plan for dealing with emergencies related to hazardous substances, such as spills or accidental exposures. 10. Funding: Secure funding for the implementation of the policy or strategy, as well as for ongoing research and monitoring.

Output:
First, we need to identify the hazardous substances that the population is most exposed to. This could be done through surveys, studies, or by analyzing existing data. Second, we need to understand how the population is being exposed to these substances. Are they in the air? In the water? In certain types of food? Third, we need to develop strategies to reduce exposure. This could involve regulations to limit the amount of the substance that can be released into the environment, education campaigns to inform the public about how to avoid exposure, or research into safer alternatives to the hazardous substance.Fourth, we need to implement these strategies. This could involve passing new laws, launching public health campaigns, or funding research into alternatives.Finally, we need to monitor the effectiveness of these strategies. This could involve ongoing surveys or studies to measure levels of exposure, or tracking health outcomes that are linked to exposure to the substance. Throughout this process, it's important to engage with stakeholders, including the public, industry, and other government agencies, to ensure that the strategies are feasible, effective, and have broad support.
