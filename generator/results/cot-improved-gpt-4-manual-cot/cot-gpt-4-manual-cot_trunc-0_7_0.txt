Output:
1. Establish International Research Collaborations: Encourage and facilitate collaborations between cancer research institutions globally. This can be achieved through joint research projects, exchange programs for researchers, and shared resources and databases.2. Standardize Research Protocols: Develop and implement standardized research protocols to ensure consistency and comparability of research findings across different countries. This will also facilitate data sharing and meta-analysis of studies.3. Promote Open Access: Encourage open access to research findings to promote knowledge sharing and avoid duplication of research efforts. This can be achieved through open access journals and databases.4. Organize International Conferences and Workshops: Regular international conferences and workshops can provide a platform for researchers to share their findings, discuss challenges, and explore potential collaborations.5. Secure Funding: Seek funding from international organizations, governments, and philanthropic entities to support international collaborative research projects. This can also include establishing joint funding schemes for collaborative projects.6. Develop Training Programs: Develop international training programs to build capacity in cancer research, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This can include fellowships, scholarships, and online courses.7. Advocate for Policy Support: Advocate for policy support from governments and international organizations to facilitate international cooperation in cancer research. This can include policies on data sharing, intellectual property rights, and research ethics.8. Establish a Global Cancer Research Network: Establish a global network of cancer research institutions to facilitate communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.9. Encourage Multidisciplinary Research: Encourage multidisciplinary research involving experts from different fields such as oncology, genetics, epidemiology, and public health. This can lead to more comprehensive and innovative research solutions.10. Monitor and Evaluate: Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the international cooperation strategy to identify areas for improvement and ensure the achievement of objectives.

Output:
1. Identify Key Stakeholders: The first step would be to identify key stakeholders in international cancer research. This would include research institutions, healthcare organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and government bodies from different countries.2. Establish a Common Goal: The next step would be to establish a common goal that all stakeholders can agree upon. This could be something like "To accelerate the development of effective cancer treatments through international cooperation."3. Develop a Framework for Collaboration: Once a common goal has been established, a framework for collaboration needs to be developed. This could involve setting up regular meetings or conferences where stakeholders can share their research findings, discuss challenges, and explore potential collaborations.4. Create a Data Sharing Policy: A key aspect of international cooperation in cancer research would be data sharing. A policy needs to be developed that outlines how data will be shared between stakeholders, while also ensuring that all data is handled in a way that respects privacy and confidentiality.5. Establish Funding Mechanisms: International cooperation in cancer research would likely require significant funding. A strategy needs to be developed for securing this funding, which could involve contributions from each of the stakeholders, as well as seeking funding from external sources such as government grants or philanthropic donations.6. Monitor and Evaluate Progress: Finally, a system needs to be put in place to monitor and evaluate the progress of the international cooperation. This could involve regular reports on the research findings, as well as evaluations of how effectively the stakeholders are working together. 7. Continuous Improvement: Based on the evaluations, improvements should be made to the cooperation strategy as needed. This could involve adjusting the collaboration framework, revising the data sharing policy, or seeking additional funding. By following these steps, a robust policy or research strategy can be developed to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research.
