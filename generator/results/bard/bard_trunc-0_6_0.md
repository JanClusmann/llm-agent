Summary: 
The AI model suggested to develop both policy and research strategies to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. The policy strategies include increasing access to Survivorship Care Plans (SCPs), funding research on the long-term side effects of cancer treatment, and prioritizing cancer survivorship in public health policies. The model suggested funding for research and insurance coverage improvements could play key roles in these areas. The research strategies proposed by the model topically includes developing interventions to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors, assessing the effectiveness of SCPs, and creating new models of care addressing the unique needs of cancer survivors. The model underscores the importance of a holistic approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors, attending to physical, psychological, social, and economic aspects of survivorship.

Main Ideas: 
- Increase access to Survivorship Care Plans (SCPs) for all cancer survivors through policy reforms.
- Prioritize research on long-term side effects of cancer treatment and survivorship care.
- Design interventions improving the overall quality of life for cancer survivors.
- Create novel models of care specifically addressing the long-term needs of cancer survivors.
