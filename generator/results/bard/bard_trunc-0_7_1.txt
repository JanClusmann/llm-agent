Sure, here are some policy or research strategies to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research:

* **Establish a global cancer research network.** This network would bring together researchers from around the world to share data, resources, and expertise. It would also help to coordinate research efforts and identify areas where further research is needed.
* **Create a global cancer registry.** This registry would track cancer incidence and mortality rates around the world. It would provide valuable information for researchers and policymakers to help them understand the global cancer burden and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.
* **Fund international cancer research.** There is a need for more funding for international cancer research. This funding could be used to support collaborative research projects, training programs, and infrastructure development.
* **Promote the sharing of data and resources.** Researchers often face challenges in accessing data and resources from other countries. This can hinder progress in cancer research. There is a need to develop mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of data and resources between countries.
* **Address ethical and regulatory challenges.** There are a number of ethical and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed in order to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research. These challenges include the protection of patient privacy, the sharing of sensitive data, and the harmonization of regulatory frameworks.

These are just some of the policy or research strategies that could be used to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research. By working together, countries around the world can make significant progress in the fight against cancer.

In addition to the above, here are some other specific actions that could be taken:

* **Support the development of new cancer vaccines.** Cancer vaccines have the potential to prevent cancer or reduce the risk of recurrence. However, there is still a need for more research in this area.
* **Invest in early detection and screening programs.** Early detection and screening can help to save lives. However, these programs are not available to everyone, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
* **Promote healthy lifestyles.** Many cancers are preventable through healthy lifestyle choices, such as not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.
* **Empower patients and their families.** Patients and their families play an important role in the fight against cancer. They can advocate for better cancer care, raise awareness of cancer prevention, and support research.

By taking these actions, we can make a real difference in the fight against cancer.
