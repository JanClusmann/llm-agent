Summary: 
The AI model suggested to increase the price of cigarettes by 10% annually for the next five years in the UK, making the product less affordable and less accessible. It also recommended a total ban on smoking in public places and running public awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking. Alongside these measures, the AI model proposed free smoking cessation programs through the National Health Service (NHS). Additionally, the model suggested that graphic health warnings should be made larger on tobacco products, a ban on flavored tobacco, tougher regulations to prevent youth accessibility to tobacco, and more investment in research on tobacco control strategies.
