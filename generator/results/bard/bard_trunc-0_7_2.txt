Sure, here are some policy and research strategies to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research:

* **Establish a global cancer research network.** This network would bring together researchers from all over the world to share data, resources, and expertise. It would also help to coordinate cancer research efforts and ensure that they are aligned with the best available evidence.
* **Create a global cancer registry.** This registry would collect data on cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality from all over the world. This data would be used to track the global cancer burden and identify trends in cancer incidence and mortality.
* **Develop global standards for cancer prevention and treatment.** These standards would help to ensure that cancer prevention and treatment programs are effective and accessible to people all over the world.
* **Increase funding for cancer research.** This would allow researchers to conduct more research on cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.
* **Promote public awareness of cancer.** This would help people to understand the risks of cancer and the importance of early detection and treatment.

These are just a few of the policy and research strategies that could be used to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research. By working together, we can make progress in the fight against cancer and improve the lives of people all over the world.

Here are some additional specific actions that could be taken to strengthen international cooperation in cancer research:

* **Create a global cancer research fund.** This fund would provide financial support for cancer research projects that are conducted in collaboration with researchers from different countries.
* **Establish a global cancer research clearinghouse.** This clearinghouse would provide a central repository for information on cancer research, including research papers, data sets, and protocols.
* **Organize regular international cancer research conferences.** These conferences would provide a forum for researchers from all over the world to share their findings and collaborate on new research projects.

By taking these actions, we can make it easier for researchers from different countries to work together and accelerate the pace of cancer research. This will help us to develop new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, treat, and cure cancer.
