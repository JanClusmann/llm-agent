Here are some recommendations to enhance breast cancer early detection programs in Europe:

* **Increase the target population for screening.** The current target population for breast cancer screening in most European countries is women between the ages of 50 and 69. However, research has shown that breast cancer can occur in women of all ages, so it is important to extend screening to younger women. The new EU approach on cancer screening recommends extending the target group for breast cancer screening to include women between 45 and 74 years of age.
* **Make screening more accessible.** One of the biggest barriers to breast cancer screening is lack of access. This can be due to a number of factors, such as distance to a screening facility, lack of transportation, or lack of insurance coverage. It is important to make screening more accessible by increasing the number of screening facilities, providing transportation assistance, and making screening affordable.
* **Improve communication about screening.** Many women are not aware of the benefits of breast cancer screening or the importance of getting screened. It is important to improve communication about screening by raising awareness of the risks of breast cancer, the benefits of screening, and the availability of screening programs. This can be done through public education campaigns, outreach to at-risk populations, and better coordination between healthcare providers.
* **Use new technologies to improve screening.** There are a number of new technologies that have the potential to improve breast cancer screening, such as digital mammography, tomosynthesis, and molecular imaging. These technologies can help to improve the accuracy of screening and reduce the number of false positives. It is important to evaluate these new technologies and to make them available to women who are eligible for screening.

By implementing these recommendations, we can help to increase the number of women who are screened for breast cancer and reduce the number of deaths from this disease.

In addition to the above, here are some other specific recommendations that could be implemented in Europe:

* **Develop a comprehensive national breast cancer screening program.** This would ensure that all women in a country have access to quality screening services, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status.
* **Provide financial incentives to women who participate in screening programs.** This could help to offset the cost of screening and encourage more women to participate.
* **Train healthcare providers on breast cancer screening.** This would ensure that all women receive high-quality screening services, regardless of the provider they see.
* **Monitor the effectiveness of breast cancer screening programs.** This would help to ensure that the programs are meeting their goals and that they are being used effectively.

By implementing these recommendations, we can make a significant difference in the fight against breast cancer in Europe.
