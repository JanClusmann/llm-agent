Sure, here is a policy proposal to reduce tobacco consumption in the United Kingdom:

* **Increase the price of tobacco products.** This is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco consumption, as it makes cigarettes less affordable and therefore less likely to be smoked. The UK government could increase the price of tobacco products by raising taxes on them.
* **Ban smoking in all public places.** This would protect people from secondhand smoke, which is a major health hazard. The UK government could ban smoking in all public places, including workplaces, restaurants, and bars.
* **Implement comprehensive smoke-free legislation.** This would include banning smoking in all enclosed public places, as well as on public transport and in workplaces. The UK government could implement comprehensive smoke-free legislation by amending the Smoke-free (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2006.
* **Prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors.** This would help to prevent young people from starting to smoke. The UK government could prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors by amending the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016.
* **Provide support for people who want to quit smoking.** This could include providing free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counseling services. The UK government could provide support for people who want to quit smoking by expanding the NHS Smoking Cessation Programme.

These are just some of the policy proposals that could be implemented to reduce tobacco consumption in the UK. By taking these steps, the government could help to save lives and improve the health of the nation.

In addition to these policy proposals, the UK government could also raise awareness of the dangers of tobacco smoking through public education campaigns. These campaigns could focus on the health risks of smoking, the social costs of smoking, and the resources available to help people quit smoking.

By taking a comprehensive approach to tobacco control, the UK government can make a significant difference in the fight against tobacco smoking.
