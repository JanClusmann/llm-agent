Summary: 
The AI model suggested to establish a two-day workshop format for a training program focussed on early cancer detection and referral. Designed for primary care physicians, this program would cover topics such as symptoms of cancer, cancer screening guidelines, risk assessment, and referral procedures. On the first day, theoretical aspects of cancer detection would be addressed, with the second day dedicated to practical skills. The curriculum would be delivered by a team of oncology specialists and healthcare professionals. The effectiveness of the training program would be evaluated through pre- and post-tests, participant surveys, and focus groups. The program, priced at $500 per participant, would be offered twice yearly, with registration opening six months ahead of the workshop.
