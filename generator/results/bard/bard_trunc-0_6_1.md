Summary: 
The AI model proposed a blend of policy and research strategies to enhance the quality of life of cancer survivors. The model recommended policy strategies to include raising access to cost-effective healthcare for survivors, promoting programs dedicated to cancer survivorship, and encouraging workplace accommodations for survivors. On the research front, it suggested three primary strategies: investing in research into the long-term effects of cancer treatment, developing new treatments with fewer side effects, and exploring complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in cancer survivorship. This multifaceted approach targets the physical, emotional, and financial challenges associated with surviving cancer, ultimately aiming to provide survivors with resources for a healthier and fulfilling life.

Main Ideas:
