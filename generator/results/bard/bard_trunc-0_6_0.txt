Sure, here are some policy and research strategies that could be implemented to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors:

**Policy Strategies**

* **Increase access to survivorship care plans.** Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are a critical tool for helping cancer survivors manage their long-term health needs. However, not all cancer survivors have access to an SCP. Policymakers could increase access to SCPs by requiring all cancer survivors to receive one at the end of their treatment, or by making SCPs a covered benefit under insurance plans.
* **Fund research on long-term side effects of cancer treatment.** Many cancer survivors experience long-term side effects of their treatment, such as fatigue, pain, and cognitive impairment. More research is needed to understand these side effects and develop effective treatments. Policymakers could fund research on long-term side effects of cancer treatment by increasing funding for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and other cancer research organizations.
* **Make cancer survivorship a public health priority.** Cancer survivorship is a public health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Policymakers could make cancer survivorship a public health priority by investing in programs and services that support cancer survivors, such as cancer survivorship centers and support groups.

**Research Strategies**

* **Identify and develop interventions to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.** There is a need for more research on interventions that can improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. Such interventions could target physical, psychological, social, and economic aspects of survivorship.
* **Evaluate the effectiveness of survivorship care plans.** Survivorship care plans are a promising tool for improving the quality of life of cancer survivors, but more research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness. Policymakers could fund research to evaluate the effectiveness of SCPs by providing grants to cancer research organizations.
* **Develop new models of care for cancer survivors.** The traditional model of cancer care focuses on curing the disease. However, cancer survivors also need ongoing care to manage their long-term health needs. Policymakers could support the development of new models of care for cancer survivors by funding research and pilot programs.

These are just a few of the policy and research strategies that could be implemented to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. By taking action, we can help ensure that all cancer survivors have the resources and support they need to live long, healthy, and fulfilling lives.
