Summary: 
The AI model suggested two sets of strategies to reduce exposure to hazardous substances, which are policy and research strategies. Firstly, it proposed policy strategies including strengthening chemical regulations, promoting the use of safer chemicals, improving environmental monitoring, and protecting vulnerable populations. Secondly, it recommended research strategies such as identifying new hazardous substances, studying their health effects, and developing new methods for reducing exposure. The AI reasoned these strategies could collectively help protect public health and foster a healthier environment. Furthermore, it stressed the importance of raising awareness and educating the public on the dangers of hazardous substances to effectively reduce exposure.

Main Ideas: 
- Strengthen chemical regulations to ensure safety and accuracy of information.
- Promote the use of safer chemicals through incentives and consumer education.
- Research on identifying new hazardous substances, understanding their health effects, and developing exposure-reduction methods.
- Raise awareness and educate the public on the dangers of hazardous substances.
