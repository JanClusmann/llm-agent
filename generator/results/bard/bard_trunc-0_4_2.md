## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model proposes the integration of four main technological advances into personalized cancer care: liquid biopsies for early cancer detection, artificial intelligence for improved diagnosis and treatment, telehealth for better access to care, and new treatments like proton beam therapy and immunotherapy. It also suggests the potential of including other advances such as nanomedicine, gene editing technologies, and cancer vaccines in future.

Main Ideas: 
- Incorporation of Liquid Biopsies, AI, Telehealth, Proton Beam Therapy, and Immunotherapy in personalized cancer care.
- Potentially developing the use of Nanomedicine to target cancer cells precisely. 
- The use of gene editing technologies and development of cancer vaccines for future inclusion in cancer care.

Main Finding: 
- Liquid biopsies, AI, Telehealth, new treatments can potentially improve cancer detection, diagnosis, treatment, and access to care.
- Nanomedicine can potentially reduce side effects of cancer treatment by precision targeting.
- Gene editing technologies and cancer vaccines could pave the way to new treatments and prevention methods.
