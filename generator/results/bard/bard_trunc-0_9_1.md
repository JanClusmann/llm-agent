Summary: 
The AI model suggested a combination of policy and research strategies to limit the exposure of the population to hazardous elements. In terms of policy, it proposed reinforcing chemical regulations, advancing workplace safety, and enhancing public health protection. Strengthening chemical regulations may involve manufacturers testing product safety and providing clear labelling on exposure risks. Increasing workplace safety might necessitate the provision of adequate ventilation and personal protective equipment for personnel handling hazardous materials. In terms of public health, monitoring air and water quality for harmful substances, educating the public about hazardous substances risks could be effective. For research, the model recommended identifying new harmful substances, studying their health impacts, and creating technologies for minimizing harmful substance exposure. Alongside these measures, raising awareness around the threats of hazardous substance exposure through public education strategies is also recommended.

Main Ideas:
- Reinforcing chemical regulations by requiring manufacturers to ensure product safety and provide clear labelling about exposure risks. 
- Upgrading workplace safety and public health protections by implementing measures such as monitoring environmental quality and providing adequate protective devices for employees.
- Conducting research to identify new hazardous substances, study their health effects, and develop technologies to reduce their environmental presence.
- Implementing education campaigns and outreach programs to raise awareness about the risks of hazardous substance exposure.
