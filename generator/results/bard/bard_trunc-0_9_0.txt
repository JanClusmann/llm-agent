Sure, here is a policy or research strategy to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances:

**Policy:**

* **Establish and enforce regulations to restrict the use of hazardous substances.** This could include banning the use of certain substances, setting limits on exposure levels, and requiring manufacturers to use safer alternatives.
* **Require businesses to conduct risk assessments and implement control measures to reduce exposure to hazardous substances.** This could include using engineering controls, such as ventilation systems, to reduce exposure in the workplace.
* **Provide workers with training on the hazards of hazardous substances and the procedures for preventing exposure.** This training should be tailored to the specific hazards of the workplace.
* **Educate the public about the hazards of hazardous substances and how to reduce exposure.** This education should be targeted to the most vulnerable populations, such as children and pregnant women.

**Research:**

* **Identify new ways to detect and measure hazardous substances.** This will help to ensure that exposure levels are kept below safe limits.
* **Develop new technologies to reduce exposure to hazardous substances.** This could include developing safer manufacturing processes or new personal protective equipment.
* **Study the long-term health effects of exposure to hazardous substances.** This will help to identify new hazards and develop more effective prevention strategies.

This is just a brief overview of some of the policies and research that could be used to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances. By taking these steps, we can help to protect the health and safety of people around the world.

In addition to the above, here are some other specific actions that could be taken:

* **Promote the use of safer chemicals.** This could be done through government regulations, market-based incentives, or public awareness campaigns.
* **Improve waste management practices.** This will help to reduce the amount of hazardous substances that are released into the environment.
* **Support research into the development of new technologies for the safe handling and disposal of hazardous substances.**

By taking these steps, we can make a significant difference in reducing the exposure of the population to hazardous substances.
