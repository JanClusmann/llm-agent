Sure, here are some policy and research strategies to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances:

**Policy**

* **Strengthen chemical regulations.** This includes requiring manufacturers to test their products for safety and to provide clear labeling about the risks of exposure. It also includes banning or restricting the use of the most hazardous chemicals.
* **Improve workplace safety.** This includes requiring employers to provide adequate ventilation and personal protective equipment to workers who are exposed to hazardous substances. It also includes training workers on how to safely handle and dispose of hazardous materials.
* **Protect public health.** This includes monitoring air and water quality for hazardous substances and taking steps to reduce exposure, such as requiring industries to install pollution control devices. It also includes providing education and outreach to the public about the risks of exposure to hazardous substances.

**Research**

* **Identify new hazardous substances.** This includes developing new methods for detecting and measuring hazardous substances in the environment and in people's bodies.
* **Study the health effects of hazardous substances.** This includes conducting long-term studies to track the health of people who are exposed to hazardous substances and to identify the long-term health effects.
* **Develop new technologies to reduce exposure to hazardous substances.** This includes developing new ways to detoxify hazardous substances and to remove them from the environment.

These are just some of the policy and research strategies that can be used to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances. By taking these steps, we can protect the health of people and the environment for generations to come.

In addition to these strategies, it is also important to raise awareness about the risks of exposure to hazardous substances. This can be done through public education campaigns, school programs, and community outreach. By increasing awareness, we can help people make informed decisions about their exposure to hazardous substances and take steps to protect themselves and their families.
