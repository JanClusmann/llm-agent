## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggested a policy and research strategy, which involves employing the collective data of wearables for cancer screening. The policy should consist of guidelines addressing privacy, security, and ethical implications of data utilisation. There must be promotion of wearables in high-risk populations through awareness campaigns and collaborations with healthcare providers. It also emphasized the need for funding research into algorithm development and other methods of utilising wearable data for cancer detection. The research part of the strategy suggests conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of wearables compared to traditional screening methods. Ethic implications also need to be studied, addressing issues like privacy and security. The AI indicates that the cost, data analysis, comfort of wearable devices, and privacy and security of data could be potential barriers.

Main Ideas: 
• Develop guidelines for the usage of wearable data, addressing privacy, security, and ethical concerns.
• Research and developing new algorithms are crucial for utilizing wearable data for cancer detection.
• Promote the use of wearables for cancer screening among high-risk populations.
• Address potential barriers, including the cost of wearable devices, the comfort and accuracy of devices, and the protection of data.
