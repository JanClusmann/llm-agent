Summary: 
The AI model suggested a policy and research strategy approach to reduce people's exposure to hazardous substances. It proposed designing enforced regulations that limit the use of dangerous substances while requiring businesses to adhere to risk assessments and control measures. These control measures incorporate techniques like using ventilation systems to decrease exposure in the workplace. The model also advised on educating workers and the public about the dangers of these hazardous substances. On the research side, among the prospects were the discovery of new methods to detect and measure toxic substances and the development of new technologies to lessen exposure. The model also proposed studying the long-term health implications of these substances to shape more effective preventative strategies.

Main Ideas: 
- Enforcement of regulations to limit the use of hazardous substances, implementation of control measures and conducting risk assessments in workplaces.
- Education and training for workers and the public on the dangers of hazardous substances and prevention measures.
- Research to identify and measure hazardous substances, create new technologies towards reducing exposure and explore long-term health effects.
- Support development of safer chemicals, enhance waste management practices and new technologies for safer handling and disposal of hazardous substances.
