Sure, here are some policy and research strategies to address cancer risks associated with HPV and Hepatitis B infections:

**Policy**

* **Expand access to HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines.** The HPV vaccine is currently recommended for all girls and boys ages 11-12, but it can be given as early as age 9. The Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants at birth. Expanding access to these vaccines will help to protect more people from these infections and reduce their risk of cancer.
* **Improve screening for HPV and Hepatitis B.** Screening for HPV and Hepatitis B can help to identify people who are infected with these viruses and who may be at increased risk of cancer. Screening programs should be made available to all people who are at risk of these infections, including sexually active adults and people who have traveled to countries where these infections are common.
* **Educate the public about HPV and Hepatitis B.** Many people are not aware of the cancer risks associated with HPV and Hepatitis B. Public education campaigns can help to raise awareness of these risks and encourage people to get vaccinated and screened.

**Research**

* **Investigate new ways to prevent HPV and Hepatitis B infections.** There is still a need for new and effective ways to prevent HPV and Hepatitis B infections. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines and other preventive measures.
* **Study the long-term effects of HPV and Hepatitis B infections.** More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of HPV and Hepatitis B infections on cancer risk. This research will help to identify people who are at highest risk of cancer and develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

These are just a few policy and research strategies that can be used to address cancer risks associated with HPV and Hepatitis B infections. By taking these steps, we can help to protect more people from these infections and reduce their risk of cancer.

In addition to these strategies, it is also important to support the research that is being done to develop new vaccines and treatments for HPV and Hepatitis B. By funding research, we can help to accelerate the pace of discovery and make these new prevention and treatment options available to more people.
