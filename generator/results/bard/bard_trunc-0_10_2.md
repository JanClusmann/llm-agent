Summary: 
The proposed approach entails boosting vaccination rates, making screenings for HPV and Hepatitis B more accessible, and publicising the risks associated with these infections. They also involve the initiation of studies on new prevention methods and the improvement of treatments for HPV- and Hepatitis B-related cancers alongside investigations into the long-term effects of these infections. The overarching goal is to reduce infection rates and, consequently, the number of related cancer cases.

Main Ideas:
- Enhancement of HPV and Hepatitis B vaccination and screening accessibility.
- Public education on risks and necessary protective measures against HPV and Hepatitis B.
- Research on prevention techniques, treatment options and long-term effects of HPV and Hepatitis B.

Main Finding: 
- Vaccination rates are too low, particularly in low-to-middle income countries.
- There is room for improvement for treatments of HPV- and Hepatitis B-related cancers.
- Many people are unaware of the risks of HPV and Hepatitis B, and the urgency of vaccination and screening.
