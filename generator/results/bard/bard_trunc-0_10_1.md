## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model suggests a two-pronged approach including policy changes and scientific research to decrease the number of cancers caused by HPV and Hepatitis B infections. The policy side includes increasing accessibility to vaccines, improving screening methods, and educating the public on the risks. The research side aims to find new ways to prevent these infections and study their long-term effects on cancer risks.

Main Ideas: 
- Expanding vaccine accessibility and improving screening programs.
- Raising public awareness about HPV and Hepatitis B risks through education campaigns.
- Researching new preventive measures and studying the long-term effects of these infections on cancer risk.

Main Finding: 
- HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines and screenings are potent tools for cancer prevention.
- Public knowledge gap exists about the cancer risks associated with these diseases and needs addressing.
- Further research is essential to develop new preventive measures and better understand the diseases' impact on cancer risk.

Novelty: 6 
(Basic, effective concepts with an established preventive approach for the infections, though further research is encouraged.)

Feasibility: 8 
(The strategies promoted are in principle readily implementable, it merely requires policy changes and funding support.)

Correctness: 9 
(The suggestions are scientifically sound and align with existing guidelines for the prevention and management of HPV and Hepatitis B infections.)
