Sure, here is a policy proposal to reduce tobacco consumption in the United Kingdom:

* **Increase taxes on tobacco products.** This is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco consumption, as it makes cigarettes and other tobacco products more expensive. The UK government could increase taxes on tobacco products by 20%, which would be expected to reduce smoking rates by 2%.
* **Ban the sale of flavored tobacco products.** Flavored tobacco products, such as menthol cigarettes, are especially appealing to young people. Banning the sale of these products would make it more difficult for young people to start smoking and would help to reduce the number of smokers overall.
* **Implement a comprehensive smoke-free law.** A comprehensive smoke-free law would ban smoking in all public places, including workplaces, restaurants, and bars. This would protect people from secondhand smoke, which is a major health hazard.
* **Provide more support for people who want to quit smoking.** The UK government could provide more support for people who want to quit smoking, such as free smoking cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. This would help more people to quit smoking and reduce tobacco consumption overall.
* **Educate the public about the dangers of tobacco use.** The UK government could educate the public about the dangers of tobacco use through public service announcements, school programs, and other initiatives. This would help to raise awareness of the health risks of smoking and encourage people to quit.

These are just a few of the policies that could be implemented to reduce tobacco consumption in the UK. By taking these steps, the government could help to protect the health of its citizens and reduce the number of deaths caused by tobacco use.

In addition to these specific policies, the UK government could also work to strengthen its existing tobacco control laws and regulations. For example, the government could:

* **Require tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients in their products.** This would allow people to make more informed decisions about whether or not to smoke.
* **Ban the use of tobacco advertising and promotion.** This would help to reduce the appeal of tobacco products to young people.
* **Strengthen the penalties for selling tobacco products to minors.** This would help to prevent young people from starting to smoke.

By taking these steps, the UK government could make a significant difference in the fight against tobacco use.
