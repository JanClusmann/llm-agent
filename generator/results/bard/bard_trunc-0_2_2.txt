Sure, here is a policy to reduce tobacco consumption in the United Kingdom:

* **Increase the price of cigarettes.** This is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco consumption, as it makes cigarettes less affordable and less accessible. The UK government could increase the price of cigarettes by 10% per year for the next five years.
* **Ban smoking in all public places.** This would protect people from secondhand smoke, which is a major health hazard. The UK government could ban smoking in all workplaces, restaurants, bars, and other public places.
* **Run public awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking.** These campaigns could educate people about the health risks of smoking, as well as the social and economic costs of tobacco use. The UK government could partner with health organizations and other stakeholders to run these campaigns.
* **Provide free smoking cessation programs.** These programs can help people quit smoking and stay quit. The UK government could provide free smoking cessation programs through the National Health Service (NHS).

These are just a few examples of policies that could be implemented to reduce tobacco consumption in the UK. By implementing a combination of these policies, the UK government could make a significant impact on the health of its citizens.

Here are some additional policies that could be considered:

* **Require tobacco companies to put larger, more graphic health warnings on their products.**
* **Ban the sale of flavored tobacco products.**
* **Make it more difficult for young people to get their hands on tobacco products.**
* **Invest in research on new tobacco control strategies.**

By taking these steps, the UK government could help to create a tobacco-free generation.
