Policy Name: Comprehensive Tobacco Reduction Initiative (CTRI)

1. Taxation and Pricing: Tobacco products should be subjected to higher levels of taxation, hence leading to higher prices. This policy shall act as a deterrent, discouraging individuals from purchasing or using these products due to their cost. Tax revenues can be used to fund healthcare and anti-smoking campaigns.

2. Plain Packaging and Health Warnings: Enforce laws that require tobacco products to be sold in plain, drab-colored packaging stripped of all brand imagery to decrease its appeal. Additionally, packaging should feature pictorial health warnings covering a substantial percentage (at least 70%) of the front and back.

3. Smoke-Free Public Places: Implement complete smoke-free laws in all public places including restaurants, pubs, offices, parks, and public transport. This will reduce the exposure of non-smokers to second-hand smoke and create an environment that discourages smoking.

4. Banning Tobacco Advertising: Enact a thorough ban on all forms of direct and indirect advertising, promotion, and sponsorship of tobacco products. This includes prohibitions on print media, billboards, TV, radio, and online advancements.

5. Tobacco Cessation Programs: Invest in healthcare initiatives promoting drop-in clinics, helplines, and counseling options for those wishing to quit. Financial support should also be made available for pharmacological aids to quitting, such as nicotine replacement therapies or medications.

6. Youth-Oriented Campaigns: Carry out sustained public health campaigns in schools, colleges, universities, and youth centers that educate about the dangers of smoking. Civic and youth organizations can be involved in these campaigns which can use various mediums such as videos, virtual reality, or social media influencers.

7. Age Verification: Enforce stricter rules around the selling of tobacco products to underage individuals. Retailers should be required to ask for verifiable identification if the customer appears under the age of 30.

8. Cigarette Vending Machine Ban: Ban cigarette vending machines to protect underage individuals who might easily gain access to cigarettes from these machines.

The Comprehensive Tobacco Reduction Initiative aims to create a sustained, long-term decrease in tobacco usage rates within the specific European country. These measures target all demographics but focus heavily on preventing the start of tobacco use in younger populations. This comprehensive, multi-faceted approach has the best chance of effectively reducing tobacco consumption.
