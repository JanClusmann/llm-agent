Summary: 
The AI model suggested a policy designed to fortify international collaboration in cancer research, with the end goal of accelerating scientific discovery. A five-pronged strategy was introduced, encouraging global partnerships, amplifying knowledge sharing, broadening training opportunities, pushing for harmonized regulations, and advocating for global cancer disparities studies. To implement these, the model proposed setting up multinational research networks, creating a global cancer research data platform, developing global standards and protocols, establishing international fellowship and exchange programs, fostering public-private partnerships and ensuring policy harmonization. Evaluation of this policy was suggested through monitoring its various effects, such as increased collaboration and data sharing, regulatory developments, training program expansion, and the reduction of global cancer care disparity.

Main Ideas: 
- Foster international partnerships and enhance knowledge sharing in the global scientific community.
- Expand training opportunities and advocate for harmonized regulatory policies in cancer research. 
- Encourage studies to resolve global cancer disparities.
- Implement these policies through forming multinational research networks, developing global standards and programs, encouraging public-private partnerships, and ensuring policy uniformity.
