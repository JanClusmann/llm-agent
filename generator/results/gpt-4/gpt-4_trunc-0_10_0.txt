Title: Prevention and Control of Hepatitis B and HPV related Cancer Risk

Policy or Research Strategy:

1. Information Dissemination and Public Education: Regular outreach programs and campaigns should be created to educate the public about the risks and prevention of HBV, HPV infection and related cancers. This includes sharing knowledge about the modes of transmission, symptoms and the significance of vaccination and regular check-ups.

2. Routine Screening and Vaccination Programs: Offer routine check-ups, screenings, detection methods like PAP tests for cervical cancer, liver function tests and imaging studies for Hepatitis B. Enhance vaccination programs for both HBV and HPV, targeting the appropriate age groups, especially the high-risk populations. Research should be conducted to make vaccines highly accessible and cost-effective. 

3. Research Fund: Increase the research fund focusing on understanding the relationship between HBV, HPV, and cancer development, finding more advanced, cost-effective and less painful treatment possibilities.

4. Patient Support Program: Develop counseling and support programs for individuals diagnosed with HPV and/or Hepatitis B, or related cancers. Create awareness about these programs to ensure maximum participation.

5. Collaboration: Collaborate with schools, universities, and workplaces for immunization campaigns to achieve comprehensive coverage. Partner with international health organizations to understand global trends and successful strategies.

6. Implementation of HBV and HPV Vaccination in Routine Child Immunization Schedule: Advocate for the inclusion of both vaccines (HBV and HPV) in the routine immunization schedule for children. Research should be conducted to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccines in different demographic groups.

7. Surveillance and Monitoring: Develop a robust surveillance system to track HBV and HPV infections and related cancers for early detection and treatment. Study the impact of various interventions on the trends of these diseases.

8. Training and Development: Regular training programs for healthcare providers on the latest research findings and effective communication about HPV and Hepatitis B to patients. 

9. Legislation: Advocate for legislation that supports and promotes routine screenings, vaccinations and research funding for HPV and Hepatitis B. 

10. Risk reduction: Promote the need for risk-reducing behaviors, such as safer sex practices and limiting number of sexual partners for HPV; and avoiding sharing of needles, safe sex, and limitation of alcohol consumption for HBV.

This policy or research strategy intends to actively identify HPV and HBV infections early and initiate appropriate interventions that can significantly reduce cancer risks. Additionally, it enhances scientific knowledge through research, improving the likelihood of better prevention measures and treatment options.
