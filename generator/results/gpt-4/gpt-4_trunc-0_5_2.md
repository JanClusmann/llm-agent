Summary: 
The AI model proposed a six-month training program for primary care physicians on early cancer detection and referral. The curriculum encompasses six modules each lasting four weeks and the learning happens one day per week. The modules explore the basics of cancer, advanced screening methods, clinical skills for early detection, communication skills & patient management, referral considerations, and ethical concerns. Workshops and seminars featuring experts in oncology and diagnostics have also been suggested to be part of the program. Regular assessments and quizzes are recommended to track a physician's progress and conclude the training with a final exam. A follow-up program including refresher courses and update sessions was suggested as a post-program measure.
