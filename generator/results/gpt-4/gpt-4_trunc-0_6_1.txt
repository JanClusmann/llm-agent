Title: Comprehensive Care and Sustainability Policy for Cancer Survivors 

I. Introduction
Our goal is to create a policy and research strategy aimed at improving the quality of life of cancer survivors. This is based on the simultaneous need for physical recovery, mental support, continuous monitoring and sustained livelihood.

II. Scope
This policy applies to cancer survivors in all age groups and across all cancer types. It encompasses clinical care, psychosocial support, research, training and advocacy.

III. Objectives

1. Develop and incorporate comprehensive post-cancer treatment protocols.
2. Improve early detection of recurrence or second primary cancers.
3. Enhance mental health support for long-term recovery.
4. Institute measures to tackle the stigma, discrimination, and social isolation experienced by cancer survivors.
5. Create inclusivity in employment and uphold survivors' rights for equal opportunities.
6. Intensify research on cancer survivorship issues.

IV. Policy Content 

1. Comprehensive Care: Establish multi-disciplinary survivorship clinics with a focus on long-term side effect management, lifestyle modification, counselling and preventive care.
