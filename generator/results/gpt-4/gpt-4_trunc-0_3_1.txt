1. Expansion of Screening Facilities: Invest in more state-of-the-art facilities across Europe, especially in remote or rural areas. This would make it more accessible for all women regardless of where they live.

2. Education and Public Awareness Campaigns: Implement health education programs to increase awareness about the significance of early detection. These programs should highlight the importance of regular self-examinations, what signs to look out for, as well as clinical and mammography screening guidelines.

3. Strengthen Primary Care Health Services: Training to health workers can be strengthened to enable them to provide information regarding breast cancer, risk factors, and the importance of early detection. 

4. Regular Follow-Ups: Implement a system that sends reminders to individuals for their next mammogram appointment or self-examination. Keeping a breast health calendar can help women keep track of their breast health activities.

5. Incorporation of New Technologies: Invest in research and development to incorporate newer technologies like 3D mammography, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to improve early detection and accuracy rates.

6. Partnering with Non-Government Organizations: Collaborate with various NGOs to gain ground in community outreach, screening campaigns, and counselling. 

7. Genetic Testing: Offer genetic testing for high-risk individuals who have family histories of breast cancer. This could be a part of targeted prevention efforts within the early detection program.

8. Health Insurance Policies: Lobby with government bodies and private insurance companies to ensure insurance plans cover regular breast cancer screenings.

9. Implement Mobile Mammography Units: Mobile units can reach people who otherwise have difficulty accessing health services due to distance, lack of transportation, or financial constraints.

10. Breast Health History: Promote recording of breast health history and keep health workers informed about it. Strive to improve patient-provider communication.

11. Peer Support Groups: Organize and promote support groups where individuals can share their experiences and encourage one another to follow through with regular screening.

12. Target Age-Specific Groups: Design specific campaigns targeted towards all age groups, especially those at a higher risk, to amplify engagement and raise awareness. 

13. Regular Assessment and Improvements: Continually assess the program for shortcomings and areas in need of improvement. Encourage participant feedback and make necessary adjustments for the betterment of the program.
