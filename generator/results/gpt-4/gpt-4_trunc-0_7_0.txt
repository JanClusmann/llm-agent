Policy/Research Strategy: 

Title: Strengthening International Cooperation in Cancer Research - A Global Initiative

1. Creation of an International Cancer Research Coalition:
Establish a platform that could act as an international body composed of cancer research institutions, governmental health organizations, medical practitioners, and researchers across the globe. This coalition could coordinate, share, and build upon research findings, aiming to create a worldwide synergistic effect in the field of cancer research.

2. Standardization of Cancer Research protocols:
Agree on a standardized set of protocols and methodologies, which could draw a clear line of understanding and ensure consistency when comparing or combining research outcomes from different countries and regions.

3. Enhance Data Sharing and Transparency:
Develop and enforce a universal data sharing policy that respects confidentiality and individual privacy rights but allows researchers worldwide to access and learn from data sets. This cooperative approach would be valuable in replicating studies, validating findings, and accelerating progress.

4. Joint Funding and Resource Allocation:
Implement joint funding programs and resources allocation for international collaborative cancer research projects. This could include direct financial support, grants, fellowships, or resources sharing such as manpower, laboratory equipment, and facilities.

5. Encourage Collaboration through Scientific Meetings and Conferences:
Increase the number of international meetings, conferences, and seminars to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, collaborations, and networking opportunities. 

6. Promote Global Research Training and Exchange Programs:
Promote exchange programs, worldwide research training, internships, or fellowships that allow the mobility of researchers across multiple borders, in turn facilitating a greater cross-pollination of ideas.

7. Publication and Dissemination of Research Findings:
Ensure that research findings are accessible and easily interpretable by researchers and the wider community. Consider the availability of global open-access journals to allow for the broad dissemination of knowledge.

8. Develop and Strengthen Research Partnerships:
Strengthen existing international partnerships and encourage new ones, promoting collaboration between developed and underdeveloped countries to ensure a global perspective and equitable access to research findings.

9. Integration with Other Health Policies and Programs:
Integrate this policy with other existing global health policies and programs that align to achieve the common goal of mitigating the global burden of cancer.

10. Monitoring, Evaluating and Refining Policy Practices:
Implement regular monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the policy strategy, inviting stakeholders input, learning from experiences and refining practices for a constant improvement. 

These strategies represent a concerted effort to encourage international cooperation, improve the quality of cancer research across borders, and ensure that the benefits of this research are shared across the globe, regardless of nationality or geographical location.
