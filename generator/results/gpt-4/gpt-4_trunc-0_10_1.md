## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model proposed a comprehensive policy and research strategy to minimize the incidence and impact of HPV and HBV-related cancers. Key aspects include ensuring accessibility to vaccinations, launching public awareness campaigns, executing regular screening programs, and integrating a robust research strategy. The plan involves close inter-sectoral cooperation, continuous assessments of policy interventions, biomarker research, genomic studies, and periodic policy and strategy evaluations.

Main Ideas: 
- Establish comprehensive vaccination, awareness, and screening programs for HPV and HBV.
- Foster research in advanced vaccine development, predictive biomarkers, and genomic studies.
- Implement regular evaluations to assess the success of interventions and adjust policies as needed.

Main Finding: 
- Accessibility to vaccinations for HPV and HBV could be improved.
- Public awareness campaigns and screening programs are effective measures for detecting infections.
- Further research in vaccine development, biomarkers, and genomic studies is vital.

Novelty: 7
- The approach is well-rounded, covering policy formation, vaccination programs, awareness campaigns, and next-gen research strategies. While not highly novel, its comprehensiveness is noteworthy.

Feasibility: 8
- Implementing the strategies requires financial resources, extensive cooperation among health organizations, and continuous efforts. Nevertheless, these are standard requirements of any society-focused health agenda.

Correctness: 10
- The AI model's proposal is factual, aligning with known strategies to minimize the risk and impact of HPV and Hepatitis B related cancers. Its focus on both preventive measures and ongoing research signifies a correct approach.
