Title: Minimizing Population Exposure to Hazardous Substances: A Comprehensive Public Health Initiative

Policy/Research Strategy:

1. Public Education and Awareness: 
 Implement a nationwide education programme detailing the hazards presented by harmful substances. This will involve the distribution of educational materials, workshops, webinars, and establishing partnerships with schools, community centers, and workplaces.

2. Regulation and Legislation:  
Advocate for stronger regulatory controls and government legislation on the storage, disposal and transportation of hazardous substances. This should include stricter penalties for non-compliance.

3. Redefinition of Industrial Processes:  
Research and promote cleaner industrial processes that minimize the generation of hazardous substances. Encourage companies to move towards environmentally friendly alternatives.

4. Hazardous Waste Management: 
 Work closely with waste management services to ensure hazardous waste is appropriately disposed of. Promote recycling and sustainability practices, along with the segregation and proper disposal of toxic waste.

5. Surveillance and Risk Assessment: 
Create systems for consistent monitoring of hazardous substances in the environment and regular risk assessments. This could be through surveys, pollution mapping, and community hazard reporting systems.

6. Community-Based Solutions:  
Engage local communities to develop and implement solutions appropriate to their specific situations. Address vulnerable and high-risk groups, such as those living in industrial areas.

7. Healthcare Professional Training:   
Ensure healthcare professionals have adequate knowledge and resources to identify and treat health issues related to hazardous substances. Include training on preventive measures and early interventions.

8. Interdisciplinary Research:  
Promote collaboration between researchers across various disciplines to better understand the extent of the problem, from detection and health implications, to policy impacts.

9. Emergency Preparedness and Response:  
Develop a comprehensive emergency response plan specific to hazardous substance exposure. This includes rapid containment and clean-up procedures, medical treatment protocols, and communication strategies.

10. Global Cooperation:   
Extend this initiative to international level, collaborating with global organizations to share knowledge, best practices, and establish international guidelines.

This policy and research strategy aims not only to reduce exposure to hazardous substances, but also to stimulate a broader cultural shift towards a healthier and cleaner environment. The approach is comprehensive, encompassing education, legislative changes, industrial practices, waste management, surveillance, and medical response.
