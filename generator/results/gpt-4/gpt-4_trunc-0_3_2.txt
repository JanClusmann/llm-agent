1. Public Awareness Campaigns: Increase public education on the importance of early screening and detection of breast cancer through media campaigns, public health forums, and community outreach programs.

2. Improve Access to Mammography: Mammography remains the most effective tool for breast cancer detection. Efforts should be taken to improve access to screening, especially in rural and underprivileged areas. The use of mobile mammography units could be effective in these instances.

3. Use of Advanced Technology: Incorporate advanced technologies like AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine learning for better accuracy in detection of breast cancer.

4. Expand Access to Genetic Testing: Identify women at high risk of developing breast cancer due to genetic predisposition and provide them with regular, more frequent screening.

5. Implement Community-Based Program: Create programs at community levels to ensure more women have access to early breast cancer screening and education about the disease.

6. Improve Healthcare Professional Training: Offer educational programs to health care professionals on the latest updates and improvements in breast cancer screenings and breast health.

7. Self Examination Education: Educate women on how to conduct self examinations regularly and what signs to look out for. This could be beneficial in ensuring early detection outside of a clinical setting.

8. Improved Follow-Up Procedures: Ensure patients who have abnormal results receive timely follow-up consultations and necessary treatments to prevent the spread of the disease.

9. Collaboration With Private Sector: Form partnerships with private companies to sponsor free screenings and other related events.

10. Regular Screening Reminders: Implement a system to remind women when they are due for their next screening.

11. Fund Research: Increased funding for research on early detection of breast cancer can help to develop new ways to detect the disease early on, even before symptoms show.

12. Include Men in Awareness Campaigns: While less common, men can get breast cancer too. It's important to include them in early detection programs and awareness campaigns. 

13. Create a National Registry: Creating a national registry for breast cancer would allow clinicians and researchers to better understand the disease and its patterns, which could lead to improvements in early detection.
