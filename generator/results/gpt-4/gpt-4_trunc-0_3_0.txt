1. Implement Comprehensive Public Education Campaign: A widespread public education campaign should be put in place, targeting both men and women of all ages to enhance awareness about the early signs and symptoms of breast cancer, how to perform self-examinations, and the importance of early detection.

2. Regular Free Screenings: Offering regular free or low-cost mammography screenings can dramatically increase the early detection of breast cancer. Mobile mammography clinics can be introduced into rural areas to ensure uneven access to healthcare does not compromise cancer detection efforts.

3. Introduce Genetic Testing: Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations should be made more accessible and affordable. Women with these mutations have a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer and should be monitored closely.

4. Enhanced Clinical Training: Allocate funds for furthering the training of healthcare providers in advanced breast cancer detection techniques. Utilize interactive platforms, such as teleconferencing and e-learning, to connect medical professionals across Europe and facilitate the sharing of skills and knowledge.

5. Regional Breast Cancer Registries: Establishing comprehensive breast cancer registries at the regional level could enhance co-ordination among different healthcare providers, streamline patient treatment journeys, and enable robust monitoring of early detection programs. 

6. Technological Advancements: Promote research and development in early detection technology, such as the use of artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostic accuracy, and ensure the widespread accessibility of these tools across Europe.

7. Strengthen Primary Care: Strengthening primary care can enable more women to receive regular check-ups, improving the likelihood of detecting breast cancer in its earliest stage. 

8. Collaborate with Non-Profit Organizations: Partner with non-profit organizations for financial assistance, community outreach, and mental health support for affected individuals. 

9. Emotional and Psychological Support: Expand resources for emotional and psychological support for those undergoing screenings. This could enhance their compliance with early detection programs.

10. Follow-up Procedures: Ensure appropriate follow-up procedures are in place for individuals with abnormal screening results to confirm or rule out the presence of cancer and, if necessary, swiftly initiate treatments. 

11. Use of Telemedicine: Expand the use of telemedicine to reach women who have limited access to hospitals or clinics, allowing for remote consultations and follow-ups.

12. Incorporate Multiple Early Detection Tests: Multiple screening methods such as Ultrasound, MRI, and clinical breast examination can be introduced as per the individual's risk profile to increase the chances of early detection.
