Summary: 
The AI model suggested an integration approach for recent technological advancements into personalized cancer care. The initiative is designed to improve diagnosis, management, monitoring and treatment plans, tailored to each patient’s genetic composition, lifestyle and personal choices. Genomic sequencing and genomic medicine were suggested for genotyping cancer, identifying mutations responsible for an individual's cancer and informing treatment choices. Further, AI and machine learning could analyze biomedical data for predictions and decision-making. Telemedicine was recommended to promote patient-provider interaction remotely, and wearable technology for continuous health monitoring. An integrated system of electronic health records was proposed for real-time tracking of a patient’s healthcare trajectory. Implementation envisages equipment acquisition, staff training, patient education and regular evaluation of system efficacy.

Main Ideas: 
- Genomic sequencing could help identify genetic mutations and guide treatment choices.
- AI and Machine Learning aids in complex data analysis for decision-making.
- Incorporating telemedicine and wearable tech to facilitate remote consultations and continuous patient health tracking.
- An integrated electronic health records system for tracking patient care trajectory.
