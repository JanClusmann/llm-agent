Summary: 
The AI model suggested to establish a comprehensive tobacco control policy in a European country, namely Hungary. The proposed policy includes raising taxes and prices on tobacco products to limit affordability, thus reducing consumption; extending public smoking bans to include places such as bars, hotels, and vehicles with minor passengers; the imposition of larger pictorial health warnings on tobacco product packaging; and implementing a comprehensive ban on all forms of tobacco product advertising, promotion, sponsorship, including cross-border advertising. Additionally, the model recommends strengthening the restrictions on tobacco product sales to minors, offering more effective quit-smoking services within the broader healthcare system, and launching mass media campaigns about the dangers of smoking. Furthermore, ongoing research and surveillance on tobacco use and the effectiveness of these interventions should be conducted. The model concludes by suggesting regulation and monitoring of tobacco industry activities and enhancing measures against illicit tobacco trade.
