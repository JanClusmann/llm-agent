Program Title: Early Cancer Detection and Referral Training Program

Goal: Enhancing primary care physicians' (PCPs) knowledge, capabilities, and confidence in early cancer detection and the correct, timely referral processes. 

Week 1 & 2: Introduction to Early Cancer Detection 

- Theory Sessions: Overview of different types of cancer, their prevalence, risk factors, and their common signs and symptoms. Customized sessions on early detection with case-based learning and interactive quizzes. 

- Practical Sessions: Demonstration of basic techniques in physical exams for early detection of cancers. A hands-on practice session to make sure doctors get comfortable with detecting any abnormalities.

Week 3 & 4: Diagnostic Measures 

- Theory Sessions: Introduction to diagnostic measures used for cancer detection like imaging techniques, different types of biopsy, genomics in cancer.

- Practical Sessions: Real-life case scenarios of cancer patients (keeping patient's privacy intact), discussion about how the diagnosis was made and how the treatment was planned.

Week 5 & 6: Interpretation of Diagnostic Test Results 

- Theory Sessions: Deep dive into the interpretation of various test results, understanding role of staging, and grading cancers, introduction to predictive and prognostic markers.

- Practical Sessions: Analyzing different test results, a practical session on interpreting them and their implication in cancer treatment.

Week 7 & 8: Effectively Communicating Cancer Diagnosis 

- Theory Sessions: Importance of effective communication and its impact on the patient-physician relationship. 

- Practical Sessions: Roleplay exercises on communicating a cancer diagnosis to patients. Discussing strategies on breaking down complex medical language into easily understandable language for patients.

Week 9: Early Cancer Referral Process 

- Theory Sessions: Importance of timely referral, understanding the referral protocols, choosing the right specialist for referral, and understanding insurance-related issues.

- Practical Sessions: Case-based discussion on when and how to make a referral.

Week 10: Evaluation and Certification 

- Evaluation measures like written tests, practical exams, and viva to assess the learning and readiness of the physicians in early cancer detection and referral.

By the end of this training program, primary care physicians should be able to efficiently detect signs and symptoms of developing cancers in patients at early stages, interpret diagnostic test results more accurately, effectively communicate with patients about their condition, and know when and how to refer patients to the appropriate specialists.
