Title: Post-Cancer Care and Recovery Strategy (PCCRS)

Objective: To design and integrate a comprehensive post-cancer care and recovery strategy to enhance the quality of life of cancer survivors.

1. Survivorship Care Plan: 

Every cancer survivor should have a personalized survivorship care plan starting from the time of diagnosis. This plan should include details about treatment received, potential side-effects, appropriate follow-ups, and lifestyle change recommendations. 

2. Rehabilitation Services: 

Establish rehabilitation services including physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. Address common issues cancer survivors face such as fatigue, physical weakness, speech difficulties, and cognitive impairment.

3. Mental Health Support: 

Address psycho-social and emotional aspects of cancer survival. Mandatory counseling sessions should be provided to cancer survivors. Implement stress management programs and recurring support group meetings.

4. Nutritional Guidance:

Cancer treatments often leave survivors with loss of appetite, taste changes or digestion problem. Professional nutritional guidance can help cancer survivors to maintain balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.

5. Active and Healthy Lifestyle Initiatives: 

Promote programs to encourage regular exercise, stress management, tobacco cessation, and other lifestyle changes which can enhance quality of life and reduce recurrence risk.

6. Long-Term Surveillance Initiative:

Develop a default protocol for long-term surveillance checks to monitor potential recurrence and manage the aftermath of cancer and its treatment.

7. Education and Awareness Program:

Patients and their family members and caregivers should be educated about the course of recovery and how to handle potential long-term side effects. They should be aware of what the survivor needs physically, emotionally, and socially.

8. Financial Support and Advise:

Cancer treatments can create a financial burden. Assistance with financial planning, availing government benefits and grants, and free medication programs should be a part of the care strategy.

9. Innovative Research: 

Invest in research focused on efficiently managing the long-term effects of cancer and improving survivors' quality of life. This could include development of medical treatments and interventions, psychosocial approaches, and lifestyle modifications.

10. Partnerships and Collaborations:

Collaborate with relevant non-profit organizations, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies to share expertise, research findings, and resources.

This comprehensive approach, encompassing various aspects of the cancer survivor's life, can substantially aid in enhancing the quality of life of these individuals during their recovery phase. Regular evaluation and update of the strategy will also be necessary to keep it aligned with ongoing research and developments.
