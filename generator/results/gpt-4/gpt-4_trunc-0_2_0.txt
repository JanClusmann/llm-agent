Policy Title: Comprehensive Tobacco Control Policy in Hungary

1. Tax and Price Measures: Increase taxes and prices of tobacco products. This would reduce affordability and thereby reduce consumption. Studies suggest that price has a significant impact on tobacco demand â€“ a 10% price increase can reduce demand by about 4-5% in high-income countries.

2. Smoke-free Laws and Regulations: Extend the ban on smoking in public places to include bars, restaurants, hotels, and vehicles with minor passengers. This would not only protect non-smokers from second hand smoke, but also create barriers to smoking, by limiting the environments in which it is legal.

3. Health Warning Labels: Implement larger pictorial health warning labels on packaging of tobacco products. Horrific images and messages about the dangers of smoking directly on packaging can deter potential users, encourage current users to quit, and prevent ex-smokers from starting again.

4. Advertising and Promotion Restrictions: Implement comprehensive bans on all forms of direct and indirect tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. These restrictions should cover cross-border advertising as well.

5. Youth Access Restrictions: Strengthen restrictions on sales to minors, including harsh penalties for violations, mandatory age-verification, and a ban on vending machine sales.

6. Cessation Programs: Increase access to and coverage of effective cessation services including, nicotine replacement therapy, counseling and quitlines. Enhance these services within the broader healthcare system, such as in hospitals, clinics and preventative health services.

7. Mass Media Campaigns: Launch mass media campaigns to educate the public about the dangers of smoking and benefits of quitting. This can promote behavior change about tobacco use.

8. Research and Surveillance: Carry out ongoing monitoring and research to examine tobacco use, the effectiveness of interventions and changing trends. This evidence should be used to continue to adapt and strengthen the policy measures.

9. Industry Accountability: Regulate and monitor the tobacco industry and their activities in Hungary, to ensure they are held accountable for the harm of their products, and not unduly influencing public health policy. 

10. Protection from Tobacco Illicit Trade: Enhance measures to curb illicit trade of tobacco, such as stronger penalties, tracking and tracing systems. This is important to maintain the effectiveness of price and tax measures.
