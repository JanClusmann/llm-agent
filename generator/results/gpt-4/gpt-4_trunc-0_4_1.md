Summary: 
The AI model suggested implementing various technological advances to boost personalized cancer care, including genomics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, robotics and digital health tools. It advocated using genomic sequencing to enhance early detection and diagnosis of cancer, and facilitate treatment plans based on the individual's genetic makeup. It proposed incorporating AI-based predictive modeling to optimize treatment plans and predict potential outcomes. Nanotech-based drug delivery systems were suggested for targeted action and to minimalize side-effects while robotic surgery was recommended for precision and less invasiveness. Use of digital health tools and wearable devices was endorsed for continuous monitoring and follow-up. The proposal also included strategies for implementation such as collaborations with associated institutions and firms, training of healthcare professionals, and continuous evaluation and monitoring to refine the personalised treatment protocols.
