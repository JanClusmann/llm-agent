Title: Proposal for the Integration of Recent Technological Advances into Personalized Cancer Care

I. Introduction
This proposal seeks to streamline the incorporation of recent technological advancements into the personalized care regimen of cancer patients. This system of care targeted at the individual would involve diagnosis, monitoring, management, and treatment tailored to the genetic makeup, lifestyle, and personal preferences of each patient.

II. The Need
Although there are significant advances in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, the disease remains a formidable health issue worldwide. This reality has underscored the pressing need for personalized cancer care. However, the critical challenge involves harnessing recent technology advancements that could help enhance personalized care provision effectiveness.

III. Objectives
The primary goal is to integrate modern technology into existing cancer care systems/structures and transform the approach from a generalized to a personalized model.

IV. The Proposal
1. Genomic Sequencing and Genomic Medicine: We propose the deployment of next-generation sequencing technologies for cancer genotyping, which could help identify the genetic mutations responsible for a particular individualâ€™s cancer. This information can guide the choice of targeted therapies, enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing side-effects.

2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): Leveraging AI and ML algorithms can help analyze complex biomedical data, make sound predictions, and assist in decision-making. The real-time analysis could lead to early detection and effective treatment plans.

3. Integration of Telemedicine: Virtual consultations would allow patients to retain contact with their healthcare providers within their comfort zones, reducing stress and facilitating better communication. Moreover, it would enable continuous remote monitoring and timely treatment modifications.

4. Wearable Technology: Wearable devices can be used to monitor patient health indicators continuously. It ensures that any undesirable changes can be detected and addressed quickly by the healthcare team.

5. Electronic Health Records (EHRs): An integrated EHR system would keep a comprehensive record of the patient's entire healthcare trajectory, enhancing precise, personalized treatment.

V. Implementation
The implementation process includes purchasing necessary equipment and software, training staff, and educating patients about the new procedures. It also involves continuous assessment of the system's effectiveness and efficiency.

VI. Conclusion
The integration of recent technological advances into personalized cancer care would require concerted efforts, substantial financial commitment, and stakeholder buy-in. However, these measures would revolutionize cancer care delivery, making it more effective, efficient, responsive, and patient-centered.

VII. Evaluation
Efficiency, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction indices would serve as measures in evaluating the integration's success. We would also measure decreased mortality rates, overall patient survival, and improved quality of life among patients.

The healthcare field needs a radical transformation in cancer care. With the integration of recent technological advances into personalized care, we are poised to witness significant improvements that can ultimately lead to reducing the cancer burden.
