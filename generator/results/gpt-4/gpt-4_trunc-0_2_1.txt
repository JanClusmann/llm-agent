Policy Title: Tobacco Consumption Reduction and Public Health Promotion, 2022

1. Promotion of Public Awareness: A nationwide campaign on the harmful effects of tobacco consumption should be promoted. This will be achieved through various means such as television advertisements, social media campaigns and billboard advertisements. Educational programs in schools and universities should be enhanced to provide awareness about the risks of tobacco consumption.

2. Increase in tax: There is a need to increase the taxation on tobacco products. As the price increases, the rate of consumption tends to decrease. The generated revenue from the increased tax can be channelled into providing better health services and funding anti-smoking campaigns.

3. Smoking cessation support: Encourage and subsidize smoking cessation programs and therapies. This may include nicotine replacement therapy, medications, and psychological support.

4. Tobacco-free environments: Implement stricter smoking restrictions in public places such as restaurants, workplaces, and parks. Laws for smoke-free environments should be enforced. 

5. Plain Packaging and Pictorial Health Warnings: Enforce laws for plain packaging of tobacco products without any brand appeal. Pictorial health warnings should be placed on the covers of the products to discourage potential consumers.

6. Age Restriction regulations: Strengthen the enforcement of age restriction laws on tobacco sales. Retailers who violate these laws should be penalized heavily.

7. Annual Health Checks: Introduce free annual health check-up programs, particularly focusing on individuals who consume tobacco products. This will help in early detection of any tobacco-related diseases and its subsequent treatment.

8. Prohibition of flavoured tobacco products: Many countries have effectively used this method to deter the youth from starting tobacco consumption. In essence, make it less appealing to begin smoking.

9. Digital Approach: Utilize social media platforms and apps to promote anti-smoking messages, especially targeting younger generations.

10. Collaboration with Healthcare Providers: Coordinate with healthcare providers to discuss the risk of tobacco use with patients and to encourage cessation efforts.

It is expected that this policy will result in a significant reduction in the rate of tobacco consumption in the targeted country, with an improvement in the overall health of the populace. Regular reviews and revisions will be carried out as needed to ensure its effectiveness.
