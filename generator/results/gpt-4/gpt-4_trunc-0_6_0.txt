Research Strategy for Improving the Quality of Life of Cancer Survivors

1. **Identifying Unique Challenges and Needs of Cancer Survivors**: The first step involves understanding the unique mental, emotional, and physical challenges that cancer survivors face. These can range from dealing with the aftermath of rigorous treatments to struggling with fear of recurrence, mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and socioeconomic challenges such as employment and insurance issues.

2. **Implement Patient-Centered Care Approach**: Develop policies that focus more on the patient's perspectives. The care approach should not just be treatment-centered, but also take into account the overall well-being of the survivors.

3. **Psychosocial Support Systems**: Research towards efficient psychosocial interventions that address the psychological and emotional distress caused by cancer. The interventions could involve counseling therapy sessions, peer support groups, online communities, etc.

4. **Post-Treatment Rehabilitation Programs**: Strategies should be developed to implement comprehensive post-treatment care plans that involve physical as well as mental rehabilitation, ensuring patients' transition back into daily life is smooth and fulfilling.

5. **Patient Education and Empowerment**: Develop education programs for cancer survivors that equip them with knowledge about self-care, nutrition, physical activities, coping mechanisms, and management of long-term side effects.

6. **Improve Access to Follow-Up Care**: Investigate ways of improving survivors' access to essential follow-up care services, irrespective of their geographical location or socioeconomic status. Utilize telemedicine or mobile health applications wherever applicable.

7. **Implementation of Survivorship Care Plans**: Integrate survivorship care plans (SCPs) into standard practice and research their effectiveness. These plans provide a blueprint for future care and lifestyle changes following cancer treatment.

8. **Quality of Life Assessment Tools**: Develop and test reliable tools and matrices to measure the quality of life in cancer survivors. These tools can be utilized to identify areas needing improvement.

9. **Long-Term Monitoring**: Design strategies for long-term monitoring of cancer survivors to assess the impact of new policies or interventions.

10. **Collaboration with Policy Makers and Insurers**: Establish collaborative partnerships with policy-makers and health insurance providers to ensure reimbursement for support services and survivorship programs.

11. **Community Outreach Programs**: Organizing community-based programs that foster social connection and promote programs for healthy living among cancer survivors.

The outcome of this research strategy will be an enhanced understanding of the factors that can improve the quality of life for cancer survivors and consequently, establishment of policies that address these areas.
