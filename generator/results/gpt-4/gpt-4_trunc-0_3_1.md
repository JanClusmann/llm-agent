Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive approach to enhance a European breast cancer early detection program. This included an expansion of screening facilities across rural and remote areas and the development of health education programs to raise awareness. By strengthening primary care services, health workers would have the means to provide important health information to women. A follow-up system and breast health calendar could help individuals manage their health more effectively. The model also proposed using new technologies like 3D mammography, AI, and machine learning. Collaboration with NGOs, genetic testing for high-risk individuals, and lobbying for better health insurance policies were additional suggestions. Using mobile mammography units, promoting the recording of breast health history, and organizing peer support groups also formed parts of the AI's strategy. The model also emphasized age-specific campaigns and regular assessment of the initiative for constant improvement.
