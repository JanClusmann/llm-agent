Policy Title: Strengthening International Collaboration in Cancer Research: A Strategy for Progress 

I. OVERVIEW

This document presents a vision for international cooperation in cancer research. It identifies key strategic areas for enhanced collaboration, aiming to accelerate the pace of discovery and clinical translation in cancer research globally. 

II. POLICY OBJECTIVES

1. Foster Global Collaboration: Encourage global partnerships between research institutions, medical centers, academia, industry and non-governmental organizations.

2. Enhance Knowledge Sharing: Promote the exchange of information, resources, and methodologies in all areas of cancer research.

3. Expand Training Opportunities: Increase international research training and exchange programs.

4. Advocate for Harmonized Regulations: Seek consistency in international regulatory policies to facilitate improved data use and research cooperation.

5. Promote Research Into Global Cancer Disparities: Encourage research and strategies to address the disparities in global cancer incidence, survival and care.

III. STRATEGIC MEASURES

1. Multinational Research Networks: Establish cross-border collaboration through joint research projects, workshops, and conferences. Ensure that these networks include low- and middle-income countries.

2. Global Cancer Research Data Platform: Develop a secure, global data-sharing infrastructure that allows researchers worldwide to share, explore, and analyze data.

3. Global Standards and Protocols: Develop and promote the use of standardized research protocols and commons data elements to enhance interoperability.

4. International Research Fellowships and Exchange Programs: Create fellowship programs that provide opportunities for education, training and mentoring between developed and developing nations.

5. Public-Private Partnerships: Encourage public-private partnerships to help advance research and development efforts.

6. Policy Harmonization: Engage international regulatory bodies to facilitate the development of compatible, transparent policies that foster international research collaboration.

IV. EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES

Establish monitoring and evaluation strategies to assess the effectiveness of the policy. The evaluation should measure the increase in international collaborative projects, improvements in data sharing practices, changes in research methods from harmonized regulations, increase in global training programmes, and reduction in global disparity in cancer care due to the efforts of the policy.

V. CONCLUSION

Strengthening international cooperation in cancer research requires a strategic, multi-faceted, and globally inclusive approach. This proposed policy and strategic plan is a call to the global cancer research community to work together more effectively for the benefit of all people affected by cancer.
