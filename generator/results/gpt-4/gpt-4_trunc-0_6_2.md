Summary: 
The AI model suggested developing a policy called the Post-Cancer Care and Recovery Strategy (PCCRS), whose key objective is to improve the lives of cancer survivors. Under the PCCRS, it emphasized the necessity of a personalized Survivorship Care Plan for every individual diagnosed with cancer. The plan should record treatment information and include follow-ups, side-effects, and lifestyle recommendations. The AI model also proposed the establishment of rehabilitation services, professional nutritional guidance, and mental health support, including mandatory counseling sessions and group support meetings. Additionally, the model suggested strategies for leading an active and healthy lifestyle, routine long-term health surveillance, and comprehensive education and awareness programs. Financial support initiatives and collaborations with relevant institutions for shared expertise and resources were also advised. Lastly, the plan urged investment in innovative research focused on managing the effects of cancer and improving survivors' quality of life.
