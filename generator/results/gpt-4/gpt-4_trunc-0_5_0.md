Summary: 
The AI model suggested a 10-week training program for primary care physicians on early cancer detection and referral. The program kicks off with an introduction to early cancer detection incorporating theory and practical sessions. Subsequent weeks cover diagnostic measures, their interpretation, effective communication strategies for delivering a diagnosis, and the referral process. The course melds theoretical knowledge and practical experiences, including demonstrations, case scenarios, role-plays, and test interpretation analysis. Participants' learning and readiness will be assessed with written exams, practical tests, and oral evaluations to ensure competence in early cancer detection and referral protocols.

Main Ideas: 
- A two-week introduction to early cancer detection, including various types and prevalence, risk factors, and signs and symptoms.
- Weeks dedicated to understanding diagnostic measures, learning to interpret test results, and appreciating the importance of clear communication when delivering diagnosis.
- A week focusing on the timely referral process, its importance and the selection of the right specialist for referral.
- A final evaluation week using written tests, practical exams, and an oral exam to ensure the physicians' proficiency.
