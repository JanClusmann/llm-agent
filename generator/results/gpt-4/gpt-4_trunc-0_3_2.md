Summary: 
The AI model suggested to enhance current early detection programs in Europe focusing on a variety of strategies. These include increasing public awareness campaigns, advancing accessibility to mammograms, incorporating advanced technologies like AI and machine learning for better detection rates, and expanding genetic testing access. The model also advocates for localized programs to maximize outreach, improved healthcare professional training, and self-examination education for women. To ensure proper reaction to abnormal results, improved follow-ups procedures are advised. Collaboration with the private sector is proposed for sponsorship of free screenings. Regular reminders for screening, increased funding for research on early detection, inclusion of men in awareness campaigns, and the creation of a national breast cancer registry for research purposes were also suggested.
