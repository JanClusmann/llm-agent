Title: Policy for Minimizing Public Exposure to Hazardous Substances (MPHS)

Objective: To design an effective strategy that significantly reduces the population's exposure to hazardous substances, thereby promoting public health and wellbeing.

Policy Components:

1. Public Awareness Campaigns: Implement awareness programs through various media, educating the public about common hazardous substances, their potential effects, and how to avoid exposure.

2. Strengthening Regulatory Framework: Upgrade current regulations to incorporate stringent guidelines to manage hazardous substances. Industries should adhere to these policies which should be regularly updated based on scientific research.

3. Hazardous Substances Inventory: Establish a national database to inventory all hazardous substances and to monitor their dispersal and use. 

4. Legislation: Implement stronger enforcement of laws and regulations. Illegal disposal of hazardous substances should carry heavy fines and/or imprisonment.

5. Surveillance and Monitoring: Regularly monitor air, water and soil quality for traces of hazardous substances. Any indication of contamination should trigger an immediate and appropriate response.

6. Worker Safety: Enforce regulations to protect workers in industries dealing with hazardous substances. This includes proper protective gear, safety protocols, regular medical check-ups, and training around handling hazardous materials. 

7. Waste Management: Establish strict waste management procedures including proper disposal, recycling, and treatment of waste containing hazardous substances.

Research Strategy:

1. Risk Assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the health effects of various hazardous substances on humans and the environment.

2. Exposure Pathways: Research the common exposure pathways in different environments like residential, occupational, and natural environment to identify and close gaps through which hazardous substances might reach the population.

3. Hazardous Substance Alternatives: Invest in research aimed at finding safer alternatives to currently used hazardous substances.

4. Evaluation of Existing Policies: Regular evaluation and improvement of existing policies based on the results of scientific research.

5. Technological innovation: Research on new technologies for detection, containment, and removal of hazardous substances or contamination.

6. Collaborative Research: Partner with international bodies and other nations to share information and leverage collective experiences and knowledge in handling hazardous substances.

Entities Involved: This policy would require the cooperation of regulatory agencies, government bodies, environmental authorities, industries, non-governmental organizations, and the general public. 

Timeline: This is a continuous process that needs regular review and updates based on the upcoming research and development in the field.
