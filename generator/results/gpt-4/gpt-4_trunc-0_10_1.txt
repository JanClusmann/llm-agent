Title: Policy and Research Strategy for Reducing Cancer Risks Associated with HPV and Hepatitis B Infections

I. Objective: To establish a comprehensive policy and research strategy to minimize the risk of HPV and Hepatitis B related cancers.

II. Background: The Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) are known to significantly increase the risk of developing several types of cancers, including cervical, oral, anal, and liver cancers.

III. Policy Development: 

1. Vaccination Programs: Ensure accessibility and affordability of HPV and HBV vaccinations, in both urban and rural areas.

2. Public Awareness Campaigns: Develop informative campaigns targeting different communities, age groups, and risk groups highlighting the risks and prevention methods for HPV and Hepatitis B infections.

3. Screening Policies: Implement regular screening programs for early detection of HPV and HBV infection, focusing on high-risk groups.

4. Inter-sectoral Cooperation: Collaborate with various health agencies, NGOs, and government bodies for effective implementation of these policies.

IV. Research Strategy:

1. Future Vaccine Development: To promote research in improving the existing vaccine regimens for both HPV and HBV related cancers by allocating funds towards research.

2. Assessing Policy Impact: Regular assessments of the policy interventions to establish effectiveness and restructure them, if needed.

3. HPV and HBV Cancer Biomarker Research: Investigate biological markers to improve early detection of cancers related to these infections.

4. Genomic Research: Explore the genomic alterations associated with HPV and HBV-related cancers, which may provide novel insight into their progression and help in the development of targeted therapies.

V. Policy and Research Evaluation: Conduct annual audits and evaluations to assess the success of policy and research strategies, and readjust as required.

VI. Conclusion: By combining enhanced public health policies with a robust research strategy, this plan aims to significantly reduce the incidence and impact of HPV and HBV-related cancers. As knowledge and technology advance, the strategy will evolve to ensure the best possible outcomes for public health.
