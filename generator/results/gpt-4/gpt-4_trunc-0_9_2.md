Summary: 
The AI model suggested to execute a policy named "Policy for Minimizing Public Exposure to Hazardous Substances (MPHS)‚Äù. The objective is to reduce the population's exposure to hazardous substances through several strategies. The components include Public Awareness Campaigns, Strengthening Regulatory Framework, Hazardous Substances Inventory, Legislation, Surveillance and Monitoring, Worker Safety, and Waste management. In addition, a research strategy that involves Risk Assessment, Exposure Pathways study, search for Hazardous Substance Alternatives, Evaluation of Existing Policies, Technological Innovation, and Collaborative Research was also proposed. The entities that would be involved in the policy consist of regulatory agencies, government bodies, environmental authorities, industries, NGOs, and the general public. The model emphasised that this process should be continuous with regular review and updates based on new findings within the field.

Main Ideas: 
-   Implementation of a robust policy to monitor and regulate exposure to hazardous substances
-   Establishing a research strategy that aims to assess risks, study exposure pathways, find alternative substances, improve existing policies, and innovate new technologies
-   Engaging various entities including government bodies, environmental authorities, industries, NGOs and the general public in the policy rollout 
-   Continual review and update of policies based on upcoming research and development in the field
