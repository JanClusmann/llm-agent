Summary: 
The AI model proposed implementing a Comprehensive Tobacco Reduction Initiative (CTRI) to curb tobacco use in a specific European country. This policy's first pillar involves the increased taxation of tobacco products, effectively raising prices and making them less financially accessible for potential consumers. Standardized, unappealing packaging featuring large-graphic health warnings are also suggested. Smoke-free laws applied to all public spaces aim to safeguard non-smokers and create a non-conducive environment for smoking. The model also recommends a complete ban on tobacco-related advertising. A cornerstone of this policy involves investment in healthcare initiatives that offer support to those seeking to quit tobacco usage, including drop-in clinics, counseling, and financial aid for pharmacological aids. Education-focused campaigns in schools and youth centers, stricter age verification rules for tobacco sales, and a ban on cigarette vending machines are other suggested measures. These initiatives aim not just to reduce but to prevent tobacco adoption among the younger demographic across the country.

Main Ideas: 
- Increase taxation on tobacco products and implement unappealing, standardized packaging featuring large graphic health warnings.
- Enforce smoking bans in public spaces and a complete prohibition on all forms of tobacco-related advertising.
- Invest in tobacco cessation programs that offer healthcare assistance, counseling, and financial aid towards quitting aids.
- Implement youth-focused awareness campaigns, stricter age verification for tobacco sales, and a ban on cigarette vending machines to discourage young people from adopting tobacco use.
