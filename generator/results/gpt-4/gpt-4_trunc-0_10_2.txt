Policy Title: HPV and Hepatitis B Associated Cancer Risk Mitigation Strategy

Objective:
To minimize the risk of HPV and Hepatitis B infections and their potential to induce cancer, particularly cervical cancer, head and neck cancers, liver cancer, and other associated malignancies.

I. Vaccination

1. Universal Vaccination: Make HPV and Hepatitis B vaccinations part of the mandatory immunization program for children, adolescents and high-risk adults. This includes making these vaccines accessible and affordable for all population segments.

2. Awareness Campaigns: Increase public awareness on the efficacy of these vaccinations in preventing associated cancers, through campaigns in schools, workplaces, and media.

II. Routine Screening

1. Regular Pap and HPV Tests: Implement a policy of regular cervical cancer screening (Pap and HPV tests) for women starting from the age of 21. 

2. Routine Hepatitis B Tests: Regular hepatitis B screenings, particularly among high-risk groups such as infants born to infected mothers, people with multiple sexual partners, and healthcare workers.

III. STD Prevention Education

1. Sex Education: Develop curriculum for schools that imparts knowledge on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), their prevention, and their potential long-term impacts such as the development of cancers.

2. Condom Use: Advocate and educate about safe sexual practices, including the use of condoms, as a method of STD prevention which can halt the spread of HPV and Hepatitis B.

IV. Research and Development

1. Enhance Research: Allocate funding for ongoing research on prevention and treatment of HPV and Hepatitis B, as well as their associated cancers. This includes research on vaccine development.

2. Surveillance and Data Collection: Implement a robust surveillance system to track data about HPV and Hepatitis B prevalence, and their linkage to cancer incidents.

V. Support for those Infected

1. Access to Treatment: Develop programs that ensure those affected by Hepatitis B and HPV have access to necessary treatments, and any emerging therapies.

2. Psychological Support: Provide counselling and psychological support as an essential part of the care for those diagnosed with HPV, Hepatitis B and associated cancers.

VI. Policy Review and Improvement

1. Regular Reviews: Conduct periodical reviews of the policy to ensure it stays updated with latest research and advancements in HPV, Hepatitis B and associated cancers.

2. Stakeholder Collaboration: Collaborate with healthcare providers and relevant stakeholders for their recommendations and input in refining the policy and implementing the strategy. 

By incorporating these measures in a systematic manner, the policy aims to reduce the incidence and mortality of HPV and Hepatitis B related cancers, ensuring a healthier society.
