Summary: 
The AI model suggested various hypothetical policy measures to reduce tobacco consumption in Lithuania. These include increasing tobacco taxes, strengthening the enforcement of smoke-free zones, expanding smoking cessation support, addressing illicit tobacco trade, developing targeted campaigns for vulnerable demographics, and monitoring emerging tobacco products. To raise public awareness, it proposed the implementation of educational campaigns, school-based programs, community engagement activities, enhancement of graphic warning labels, developing online resources and helplines, and leveraging partnerships for larger reach. The model recommended the establishment of smoke-free zones through comprehensive legislation and policy development, identification and marking of smoke-free areas, comprehensive public education, strict enforcement and compliance, as well as ongoing evaluation and monitoring. Additionally, to increase taxes on tobacco products, it recommended conducting an economic analysis, implementing a gradual tax increase, considering differential taxation, harmonizing tax rates with neighboring countries, implementing tax stamps and tracking systems, and running public awareness campaigns on the positive impacts of increased tobacco taxes.
