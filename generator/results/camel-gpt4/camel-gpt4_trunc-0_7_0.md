Summary: 
The AI model proposes a hypothetical solution to strengthening international cooperation in cancer research by designing a Python class named 'ResearchInstitution'. This class embraces an approach where data from an institution can be easily shared with its collaborative institutions hence promoting cooperation.

Main Ideas: 
- Designing a Python class 'ResearchInstitution'.
- Implementing methods for adding collaborators and sharing data with them.
- Creating instances of 'ResearchInstitution' to illustrate the concept.

Main Finding: 
- The AI model exhibits a strong understanding of class creation and manipulation in Python.
- The proposed solution emphasizes ease of data sharing among various institutions, fostering cooperation.
- The AI model takes into account the feasibility issue by proposing the use of standard Python programming language.
