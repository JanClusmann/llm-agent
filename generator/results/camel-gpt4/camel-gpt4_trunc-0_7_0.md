Summary: 
The AI model suggested to first conduct a review of the existing global cancer research initiatives and collaborations, identifying key stakeholders in the field. To facilitate international cooperation, the model proposed creating a secure, user-friendly online platform for researchers and establishing a framework for data integration. To get the required funding, the model recommended strategies like engaging government agencies, establishing partnerships and leveraging networks and advocacy. For research studies, it suggested the establishment of a committee responsible for creating protocols for these studies, with a robust review process. Finally, the model proposed that leveraging technology would aid in data integration within the consortium, highlighting the importance of data standards, a sound data integration platform, data governance and the capacity for data sharing.

Main Ideas: 
- Creating a global platform for facilitating collaborations among researchers.
- Standardization of protocols for research studies and regular evaluation for improvements.
- Leveraging technology for data integration within the global research consortium.
- Strategies for securing funding for global research consortium projects.
