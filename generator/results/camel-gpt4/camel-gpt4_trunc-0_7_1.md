Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive policy and research strategy to strengthen international collaboration in cancer research by outlining its three core components. Firstly, specialized training programs which should cover core concepts and methodologies, emerging technologies, translational research, ethical considerations, professional development, and skills in collaboration and communication. Secondly, a centralized database for organizing and storing research findings was proposed, which should have robust search capabilities, enforced data standardization, collaboration tools, data visualization capabilities, and integrate with external resources, while supporting data citation. Lastly, the model underlined the importance of establishing cross-border funding opportunities. The strategy aims to remove barriers for researchers, streamline funding processes, establish partnerships with the private sector, and create an inclusive environment for researchers globally. 

Main Ideas: 
- Specialized training programs can equip researchers with the necessary expertise to effectively contribute to cancer research.
- A centralized database can organize and store research findings, promoting global collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- Cross-border funding opportunities are crucial for driving further developments in the field, providing resources and facilitating international collaboration.
