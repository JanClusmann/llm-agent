Summary: 
The AI model has presented a comprehensive approach to reduce the exposure of the population to hazardous substances focusing on data analysis, intervention strategies, and effectiveness evaluation. The model suggested using past environmental data to identify hotspots and risk areas through clustering methods and then devise targeted measures based on the demographics of these areas. Post-implementation of these measures, the model recommends evaluating the effectivity of the solutions by comparing pre and post intervention exposure levels.

Main Ideas:
- Data analysis for identifying high-risk areas and demographics.
- Devising and implementing specific intervention strategies for the identified hotspots.
- Assessing the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing exposure risks before and after implementation.

Main Finding:
- The model can read and preprocess the historical data.
- Through K-means clustering, it can find hotspots and create an intervention strategy for those areas.
- The intervention's effectiveness can be calculated via a simple exposure risk comparison of pre and post intervention data.
