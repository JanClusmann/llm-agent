Summary: 
The AI model suggested a series of strategies aimed at decreasing the exposure of the population to hazardous substances. Key components of the approach include an analysis of existing EU legislation regarding hazardous substances, current research initiatives, considerations for a comprehensive public health campaign, and measures for integrating these aspects into a cohesive policy framework. The LLM recommended strengthening regulatory frameworks, promoting research and innovation, enhancing risk assessment and management, and increasing public awareness and education among other strategies. It also emphasised the development of a plan for regular monitoring and evaluation of the proposed frameworkâ€™s effectiveness, including establishing clear objectives and indicators, collecting relevant data, conducting regular monitoring activities and impact assessments, as well as continuously reviewing and adapting the framework based on the results and emerging needs.
