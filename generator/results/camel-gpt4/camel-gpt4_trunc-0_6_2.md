Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive and step-by-step approach to enhance care for young adult cancer survivors. The approach began with an overview of current healthcare services in the EU, followed by identifying the specific needs of this population in terms of long-term physical and mental wellbeing. To boost social inclusion and employment opportunities, the AI envisaged raising awareness, vocational training, workplace adjustments, collaborations with employers, peer support networks, and financial support. To facilitate access to specialized healthcare services, the AI suggested evaluating existing systems, creating multidisciplinary teams, improving survivorship care planning, and addressing financial barriers among other strategies. Further, the AI proposed the creation of personalized survivorship care plans and provided extensive research areas that could further enhance the EU health policy and research strategy for young adult cancer survivors.
