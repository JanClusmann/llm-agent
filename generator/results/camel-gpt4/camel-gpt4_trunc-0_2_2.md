Summary: 
The AI model proposed several strategies to reduce tobacco consumption in Belquinnia, a hypothetical European country. The model emphasized the need for a data-driven approach. This included gathering statistics on tobacco prevalence, and conducting studies on different anti-smoking measures. The model suggested increased taxation on tobacco, arguing its effectiveness in deterring price-sensitive smokers and generating government revenue for smoking cessation initiatives. Second, mandatory graphic health warnings on packaging were proposed, stating they increase awareness and evoke strong emotional responses. The model also suggested a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, allowing a shift in public perception of smoking. Another proposal was subsidizing smoking cessation programs, improving accessibility, creating a supportive environment, and yielding higher long-term success rates. The last strategy was to establish smoke-free zones in public areas to protect non-smokers and encourage people to quit smoking.

Main Ideas: 
- Increase taxation on tobacco products to deter price-sensitive smokers and subsidize anti-smoking initiatives.
- Implement mandatory graphic health warnings on packaging to raise awareness and evoke emotional responses against smoking.
- Ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship to shift public perception of smoking towards a negative and socially unacceptable behavior.
- Subsidize smoking cessation programs to increase their accessibility, customizability, and long-term success rates.
- Establish smoke-free zones in public areas to protect non-smokers and encourage people to quit smoking.
