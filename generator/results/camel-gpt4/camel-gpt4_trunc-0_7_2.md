Summary: 
The AI model suggested a comprehensive approach for strengthening international cooperation in cancer research. The approach involves several key steps such as conducting a complete literature review, examining the activities of international cancer research organizations, and analyzing funding mechanisms and data sharing platforms. The model proposes researching global regulatory processes and analyzing interdisciplinary partnerships. To overcome identified barriers to global collaboration, the model recommends tackling issues like language and cultural differences, lack of funding and resources, intellectual property concerns, and regulatory and ethical considerations. The approach also includes strategies like developing standardized data formats and protocols, creating centralized data sharing platforms, and creating a framework for fostering interdisciplinary partnerships. Finally, the AI model proposed multiple innovative funding mechanisms such as global cancer research fund, public-private partnerships, venture philanthropy, and impact investment among others.

Main Ideas: 
- Examination of current international cancer research efforts and identification of barriers to collaboration.
