Summary: 
The AI model suggested to approach the problem of decreasing cancers caused by HPV and Hepatitis B infections via four main strategies. Firstly, to have a clearer picture of the current situation, it advised to collect data from national cancer registries, analyze health surveys and review research studies. Secondly, it proposed to identify existing vaccination programs and their effectiveness in EU member states by reviewing national immunization schedules, consulting with health authorities and organizations, and analyzing vaccination coverage data. The third proposed strategy focused on enhancing vaccination rates through education and awareness campaigns, training and support for healthcare professionals, strengthening vaccination infrastructure, and fostering collaboration and coordination. The next strategy aimed to implement screening programs for HPV- and Hepatitis B-related cancers and detailed necessary steps such as identifying target populations, establishing suitable screening methods, and developing infrastructure requirements. Collaborating with healthcare professionals and organizations was emphasized here as well. Lastly, for maximum impact and long-term success, it suggested to consider innovative approaches that utilize technology, engage stakeholders, and promote sustainability, along with a comprehensive overview of the proposed EU health policy.

Main Ideas: 
- The collection and analysis of relevant data on HPV and Hepatitis B-related cancers prevalence in EU.
- Identification and analysis of existing vaccination programs, and proposal of strategies for increased immunization rates.
- Proposal for the implementation of HPV- and Hepatitis B-related cancers screening programs in EU member states.
- Utilizing innovative approaches for long-term success and providing an overview of the proposed EU health policy for mitigating HPV- and Hepatitis B-related cancers.
