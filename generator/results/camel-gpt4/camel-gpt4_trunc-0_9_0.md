Summary: 
The AI model suggested conducting a comprehensive literature review on harmful substances prevalent in the population. The review would involve defining the scope of harmful substances of concern, identifying relevant databases, developing search terms, conducting the search, evaluating selected studies, extracting and analyzing data, summarizing the findings, and documenting the review. The model also suggested analyzing existing regulations and monitoring systems in place for controlling the population's exposure to harmful substances. This can be achieved by identifying relevant regulatory bodies, reviewing legislation, evaluating national regulations, assessing monitoring systems, identifying gaps, proposing improvements, considering international best practices, and documenting the analysis. To reduce exposure to harmful substances, public awareness campaigns, innovative technologies, and collaborative initiatives were recommended. Lastly, the model suggested compiling all findings into a comprehensive research-based strategy document.
