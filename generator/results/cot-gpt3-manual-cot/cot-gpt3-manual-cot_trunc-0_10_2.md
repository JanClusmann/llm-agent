## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model failed to provide any viable approach or strategy to address the cancer risks associated with HPV and Hepatitis B infections, instead, it provided solutions to a variety of arithmetic problems unrelated to the initial prompt.

Main Ideas: 
- The AI model handled mathematical problems well, providing accurate solutions.
- The AI model did not comprehend the prompt of developing a strategy for reducing cancer risks from HPV and Hepatitis B.
- The content of the model's output misplaced the subject matter on addressing different arithmetic problems rather than the required policy research strategy.

Main Findings: 
- The AI model demonstrated ability to solve different arithmetic problems correctly.
- The model failed to understand the complexity of the task about policy development or research strategy.
- In its final response, the AI model only restated the task without contributing a potential approach or solution.
