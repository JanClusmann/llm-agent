## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model was expected to address a research strategy or policy to mitigate hazardous substance exposure. Instead, it generated unrelated mathematical problem-solving techniques. Ultimately, the model failed to discuss the prompt challenge and instead reiterated the challenge's essence.

Main Ideas: 
1. AI answers mathematical questions.
2. Model showcases a procedural approach to problem-solving. 
3. Model rephrases problem prompt rather than proposing a solution.

Main Finding: 
1. Methodical approach to mathematical problem solving demonstrated.
2. Despite having intricate problem-solving strategies, the model did not address the intended prompt.
3. The AI model did not generate a solution or strategy for the challenge proposed.
