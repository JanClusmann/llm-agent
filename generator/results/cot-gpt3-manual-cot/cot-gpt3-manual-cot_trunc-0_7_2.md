## Summary table by gpt-4
Summary: 
The AI model did not provide a distinct strategy or policy suggestion for the complex question asked, which was aimed at strengthening international cooperation in cancer research. Instead, the AI responses were more focused on solving numerical problems which were unrelated to the initial complex question. Thus, no specific output can be provided concerning the research strategy.

Main Ideas: 
- The AI model was able to accurately solve mathematical problems.
- Unrelated queries for math problem-solving were posed in the interface.
- There were no concrete ideas presented to solve the complex policy question related to enhancing international cooperation in cancer research.

Main Finding: 
- The AI model was able to answer the mathematical questions correctly.
- The complex question was not answered directly.
- No policy suggestions or research strategies were provided by the AI model for the asked question.
