Summary: 
The AI model was asked to develop a strategy to use wearable data for cancer screening. However, the model failed to provide a coherent and meaningful strategy, instead it provided irrelevant answers to mathematical arithmetic, or repeated the prompt without elaborating or expanding the idea. A definitive strategy for how wearable data could be utilized for cancer screening was not put forth.

Main Ideas: 
1. Wearable data might have potential in cancer screening 
2. Currently lacking in a coherent research strategy 
3. High requirement for policy design

Main Finding: 
1. No viable plan was suggested 
2. Shortcoming of AI in understanding complex medical subject  
3. Nonsensical answers to mathematical arithmetic 

Novelty: 1

Feasibility: 1

Correctness: 1
