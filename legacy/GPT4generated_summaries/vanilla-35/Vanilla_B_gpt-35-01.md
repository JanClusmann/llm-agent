### Answer subdivided into 1 of 1 parts:
Liver cancer mortality in Europe can be lowered through a comprehensive strategy that focuses on prevention, early detection, and effective treatment. Here are some steps that can be taken to achieve this goal:
1.	Promote healthy lifestyle habits: Encouraging people to adopt healthy habits such as maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and not smoking can help to reduce the risk of developing liver cancer.
2.	Increase awareness and education: There is a need to raise public awareness about liver cancer, its causes, risk factors, and symptoms. This can be achieved through targeted education campaigns that focus on high-risk populations.
3.	Implement screening programs: Liver cancer screening programs can help to detect the disease early when it is still treatable. Screening can be targeted at high-risk populations, such as those with chronic liver disease, hepatitis B or C infections, and those with a family history of liver cancer.
4.	Improve access to treatment: Ensuring that people have access to appropriate and effective treatments is crucial in reducing liver cancer mortality rates. This can involve improving access to surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and other treatments.
5.	Collaborate across disciplines: Collaboration across medical specialties such as hepatology, gastroenterology, oncology, and radiology can help to ensure that patients receive the best possible care. Additionally, collaboration between healthcare providers and public health officials can help to develop comprehensive liver cancer prevention and treatment programs.
6.	Encourage research: Continued research into the causes, prevention, and treatment of liver cancer is essential. This can involve supporting basic and clinical research, developing new diagnostic and treatment technologies, and investigating new therapies.
By implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses prevention, early detection, and effective treatment, it is possible to lower liver cancer mortality rates in Europe.
