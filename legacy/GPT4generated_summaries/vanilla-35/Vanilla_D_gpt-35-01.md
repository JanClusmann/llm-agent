Monitor side effects: Patients should be aware of the potential side effects associated with their medications and should monitor themselves for any new or unusual symptoms. If they experience side effects, they should promptly notify their healthcare provider.

Manage side effects: Depending on the type and severity of side effects, various strategies can help manage them. For example, some medications can cause nausea, which can be managed with medication or dietary changes. Patients may also find relief through complementary therapies such as meditation, massage, or acupuncture.

Consider lifestyle changes: Lifestyle changes such as exercise, diet, and stress management can help reduce the risk of side effects associated with these medications.

In conclusion, the best strategy to minimize the risk of side effects associated with cancer medications is to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized plan that considers the patient's medical history, lifestyle, and individual needs.
