ORIGINAL TEXT:
Objective: For a cancer patient with the following medication, create a strategy to reduce the risk of side effects: escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, oxycodone. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: What is the effectiveness of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone in reducing the risk of side effects for a cancer patient?
2: Research Question 2: How does the combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients?
3: Research Question 3: How does the individual dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone impact the risk of side effects in cancer patients?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): H0: Escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone do not reduce the risk of side effects for a cancer patient.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): H1: Escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone reduce the risk of side effects for a cancer patient.

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): The combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone does not affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): The combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone does affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Null Hypothesis (H0): The individual dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone does not impact the risk of side effects in cancer patients.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The individual dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone does impact the risk of side effects in cancer patients.
