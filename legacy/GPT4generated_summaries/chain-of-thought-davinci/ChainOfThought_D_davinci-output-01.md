ORIGINAL TEXT:
Objective: For a cancer patient with the following medication, create a strategy to reduce the risk of side effects: escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, oxycodone. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: How does escitalopram affect side effects in cancer patients?
2: Research Question 2: What is the relationship between lenvatinib and risk of side effects in cancer patients?
3: Research Question 3: To what extent do ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone influence the risk of side effects in cancer patients?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Escitalopram has no effect on side effects in cancer patients.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Escitalopram has a significant effect on side effects in cancer patients.

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): H0: There is no relationship between lenvatinib and risk of side effects in cancer patients.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): H1: There is a relationship between lenvatinib and risk of side effects in cancer patients.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): H0: There is no relationship between ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone and the risk of side effects in cancer patients.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): H1: Ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone influence the risk of side effects in cancer patients.

| The AI model proposes a hypothetical approach to study the effects of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone on side effects in cancer patients. It formulates three research questions and corresponding null and alternate hypotheses. | 1. Investigate escitalopram's effect on side effects. <br> 2. Examine the relationship between lenvatinib and side effect risk. <br> 3. Assess the influence of ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone on side effect risk. | 1. Determine if escitalopram has a significant effect on side effects. <br> 2. Establish if there is a relationship between lenvatinib and side effect risk. <br> 3. Identify if ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone influence side effect risk. | 5 | 7 | 8 |
