ORIGINAL TEXT:
Objective: For a cancer patient with the following medication, create a strategy to reduce the risk of side effects: escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, oxycodone. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: How does the combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients?
2: Research Question 2: What is the impact of ibuprofen and oxycodone on the occurrence of side effects in cancer patients taking escitalopram, lenvatinib, and ramipril?
3: Research Question 3: How does the dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, and ramipril affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients taking ibuprofen and oxycodone?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): The combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone does not affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The combination of escitalopram, lenvatinib, ramipril, ibuprofen, and oxycodone does affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients.

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the occurrence of side effects in cancer patients taking escitalopram, lenvatinib, and ramipril when taking ibuprofen and oxycodone.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the occurrence of side effects in cancer patients taking escitalopram, lenvatinib, and ramipril when taking ibuprofen and oxycodone.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): The dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, and ramipril does not affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients taking ibuprofen and oxycodone.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The dosage of escitalopram, lenvatinib, and ramipril does affect the risk of side effects in cancer patients taking ibuprofen and oxycodone.
