# Language Learning Model (LLM) AGI Evaluation Platform

This repository contains the codebase for the LLM-AGI Evaluation Platform. This platform is designed to generate, summarize, and evaluate results from various language learning models such as GPT3.5, GPT4, and Baby AGI. The evaluations are performed by human experts via a web interface.

## Getting Started
### Preparation
Clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KatherLab/llm-agent.git
```

If you are a project maintainer, follow steps from 0 to 5

Create and checkout to your own dev branch:
```shell
git checkout <dev_branchname>
```

If you are a human expert, you only need to follow steps 1, 2, 6, and 7.

Checkout to the working branch:
```shell
git checkout exp_expert_eval
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed on your system.

### Installation
0. Put the openai api key in the `generator/API_KEY` file.
***Make sure not to push this file remotely.***
***This file has already been added to gitignore.***


1. Create and install the environment by running:
```shell
conda env create -f condaenv.yml
```

2. Activate the environment:

```shell
conda activate llm-agent
```

### Running the Code


3. Run `generate.py` to generate results from the language learning models:

```shell
python generator/generate.py
```

The generated text files can be found in the `generator/results` directory.

4. Generate summarized markdown files:

```shell
python generator/summarize.py
```

5. Load the summaries into the local database:

```shell
python webui/gpt4_summaries_db.py
```


6. Run the web application:

```shell
python webui/app.py
```

Then, access the application in your favourite browser by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

7. Commit and push updates to the database:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Update database"
git push
```

## About the Platform

The web-based evaluation application allows expert users to provide ratings. This platform will expedite the procedure of collating results generated by llm-agi and evaluations from ChatGPT-4 into a comprehensive summary database. The scoring system within this web interface will construct a score database, which will have each summary ID interconnected with the main summary database. This system will enable dynamic updates when human experts submit their scores via the web interface.
