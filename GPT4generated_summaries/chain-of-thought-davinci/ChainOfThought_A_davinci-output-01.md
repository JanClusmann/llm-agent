ORIGINAL TEXT:
Objective: Find an optimal treatment strategy for this patient: female, 50 years old, history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three lesions of 3 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm diameter. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: What is the optimal treatment strategy for female patients with alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)?
2: Research Question 2: How does the size of the lesion affect the effectiveness of the treatment strategy for patients with alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)?
3: Research Question 3: What is the impact of alcohol abuse on the effectiveness of the treatment strategy for patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): There is no difference in the effectiveness of treatment strategies for female patients with alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the effectiveness of treatment strategies for female patients with alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Null Hypothesis (H0): The size of the lesion does not affect the effectiveness of the treatment strategy for patients with alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The size of the lesion does affect the effectiveness of the treatment strategy for patients with alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): There is no significant difference in the effectiveness of the treatment strategy for patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between those with and without alcohol abuse.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the effectiveness of the treatment strategy for patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, and histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between those with and without alcohol abuse.
