ORIGINAL TEXT:
Objective: Find an optimal treatment strategy for this patient: female, 50 years old, history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three lesions of 3 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm diameter. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: How does the size of the lesions affect the efficacy of treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis?
2: Research Question 2: What is the optimal treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma in female patients aged 50 with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis?
3: Research Question 3: What is the impact of alcohol abuse on the effectiveness of treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): H0: The size of the lesions does not affect the efficacy of treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): H1: The size of the lesions does affect the efficacy of treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): There is no statistically significant difference in the optimal treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma in female patients aged 50 with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis compared to other treatment strategies.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): There is a statistically significant difference in the optimal treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma in female patients aged 50 with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis compared to other treatment strategies.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant impact of alcohol abuse on the effectiveness of treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant impact of alcohol abuse on the effectiveness of treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis.

|---------|------------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| The AI model proposes a hypothetical approach to find the optimal treatment strategy for a 50-year-old female patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol abuse history, and liver cirrhosis. It suggests investigating the impact of lesion size, optimal treatment for Child-Pugh B cirrhosis, and the effect of alcohol abuse on treatment efficacy. | - Impact of lesion size <br> - Optimal treatment for Child-Pugh B cirrhosis <br> - Effect of alcohol abuse on treatment efficacy | - H0: Lesion size doesn't affect treatment efficacy <br> - H1: Lesion size affects treatment efficacy <br> - H0: No significant impact of alcohol abuse on treatment effectiveness <br> - H1: Significant impact of alcohol abuse on treatment effectiveness | 7 | 8 | 8 |
