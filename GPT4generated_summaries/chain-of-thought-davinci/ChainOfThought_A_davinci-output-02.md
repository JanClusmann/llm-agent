ORIGINAL TEXT:
Objective: Find an optimal treatment strategy for this patient: female, 50 years old, history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B, histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three lesions of 3 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm diameter. 


LIST OF REQSEARCH QUESTIONS:
1: Research Question 1: How does the duration of alcohol abuse affect the treatment outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis?
2: Research Question 2: What is the impact of the size of the lesions on the efficacy of treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis?
3: Research Question 3: How does the age of the patient affect the success rate of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis?

LIST OF HYPOTHESIS:

RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): Null Hypothesis (H0): The duration of alcohol abuse has no effect on the treatment outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The duration of alcohol abuse has an effect on the treatment outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.

RESEARCH QUESTION 2:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): H0: There is no relationship between the size of the lesions and the efficacy of treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): H1: The size of the lesions has an impact on the efficacy of treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3:
NULL HYPOTHESIS (H0): The null hypothesis (H0) for the research question is that the age of the patient does not affect the success rate of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS (H1): The alternate hypothesis (H1) for the research question is that the age of the patient does affect the success rate of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.
