- For categorical variables, calculate frequency counts and proportions for each category.

Step 4: Visualize the distribution of variables
- Create histograms or box plots for numerical variables to visualize their distribution and identify any potential outliers or skewness.
- Create bar charts or pie charts for categorical variables to visualize the distribution of categories.

Step 5: Analyze the distribution of the target variable
- Examine the distribution of the target variable(s) to understand its characteristics, such as skewness, kurtosis, or imbalance.
- If the target variable is imbalanced, consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation to balance the distribution.

Step 6: Analyze the distribution of feature variables
- Examine the distribution of feature variables and identify any potential issues, such as multicollinearity, high correlation, or high variance.
- Consider transforming or normalizing variables with skewed distributions or applying feature scaling techniques to improve model performance.

Step 7: Identify potential relationships between variables
- Create scatter plots or correlation matrices to visualize potential relationships between numerical variables.
- Use cross-tabulation or contingency tables to analyze relationships between categorical variables.

Step 8: Assess the impact of missing values
- Identify variables with missing values and calculate the proportion of missing values for each variable.
- Determine the potential impact of missing values on the model and consider strategies for handling them, such as imputation or deletion.

Step 9: Document findings and recommendations
- Summarize the findings from the variable distribution assessment, including any potential issues or concerns.
- Provide recommendations for addressing identified issues, such as data preprocessing techniques or feature engineering strategies.

Step 10: Update the dataset and model
- Implement the recommended changes to the dataset and update the model accordingly.
- Reassess the variable distribution and model performance after implementing the changes to ensure improvements have been made.

*****TASK 13 RESULT*****

Step 1: Review the dataset
- Familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables, and their distributions based on the previous tasks completed.

Step 2: Determine which variables to analyze for outliers
- Identify the continuous variables in the dataset, as these are the ones most likely to have outliers.
- Consider the importance of each variable in the context of the problem you are trying to solve.

Step 3: Visualize the data
- Create box plots or scatter plots for each continuous variable to visually identify potential outliers.
- Look for data points that appear far from the majority of the data.

Step 4: Choose an outlier detection method
- Select an appropriate method for detecting outliers based on the distribution of the data and the nature of the problem. Some common methods include:
  - Standard deviation method: Identify data points that are a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean.
  - Interquartile range (IQR) method: Identify data points that fall below the first quartile minus 1.5 times the IQR or above the third quartile plus 1.5 times the IQR.
  - Z-score method: Calculate the z-score for each data point and identify those with z-scores above a certain threshold (e.g., 2 or 3).
  - Tukey's fences: Similar to the IQR method, but using a multiplier other than 1.5 (e.g., 2.2) to define the fences.

Step 5: Apply the chosen outlier detection method
- Calculate the necessary statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, quartiles) for each continuous variable.
- Apply the chosen method to identify potential outliers in each variable.

Step 6: Assess the impact of the outliers
- Consider the context of the problem and the potential impact of the identified outliers on the model's performance.
- Determine whether the outliers are likely to be genuine anomalies or simply errors in the data.

Step 7: Remove or adjust the outliers
- If the outliers are determined to be errors or have a high likelihood of negatively impacting the model's performance, remove them from the dataset.
- If the outliers are genuine but may still impact the model's performance, consider adjusting their values (e.g., winsorizing) or transforming the variable (e.g., log transformation) to reduce their influence.

Step 8: Re-evaluate the dataset
- After removing or adjusting the outliers, re-visualize the data and re-calculate the relevant statistics to ensure the changes have had the desired effect.
- If necessary, repeat steps 3-7 until you are satisfied with the dataset's quality.

Step 9: Document the process
- Record the steps taken, the methods used, and the rationale behind your decisions for future reference and to ensure transparency in your analysis.
