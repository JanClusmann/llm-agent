### Answer subdivided into 1 of 1 parts:
Here are three potential scientific hypotheses that combine deep learning with clinical research on liver cancer:

Use deep learning to predict patient response to liver cancer treatment: Currently, treatment selection for liver cancer is often based on the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health. However, response to treatment can vary widely among patients. Deep learning could be used to analyze patient data such as tumor characteristics, genetic information, and clinical history to predict which treatments are most likely to be effective for individual patients.

Develop a deep learning algorithm to aid in early detection of liver cancer: Early detection of liver cancer is critical for successful treatment. However, diagnosis can be difficult and often relies on imaging tests that may not detect early-stage tumors. Deep learning could be used to analyze medical images and identify early signs of liver cancer that might be missed by human radiologists.

Use deep learning to identify novel biomarkers for liver cancer: Biomarkers are molecules in the body that can indicate the presence of a disease. Currently, there are few reliable biomarkers for liver cancer. Deep learning could be used to analyze large amounts of patient data, including clinical records and genetic information, to identify novel biomarkers that could be used for early detection, treatment selection, and prognosis.
