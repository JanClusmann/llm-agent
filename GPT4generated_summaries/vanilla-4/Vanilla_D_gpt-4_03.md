I am not a doctor, but I can suggest a general strategy for reducing the risk of side effects from these medications. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to a medication regimen.

Escitalopram:
Start with a low dose and gradually increase under the supervision of a doctor.
Take the medication at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels.
Monitor for side effects like drowsiness, dizziness, or gastrointestinal issues.
Lenvatinib:
Take lenvatinib on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.
Stay hydrated to minimize the risk of hypertension and kidney problems.
Monitor for side effects like fatigue, diarrhea, and skin reactions. Inform the healthcare team if any side effects occur.
Ramipril:
Start with a low dose and gradually increase it under the supervision of a doctor.
Take the medication at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels.
Monitor blood pressure regularly and report any significant changes to the healthcare team.
Ibuprofen:
Take ibuprofen with food or milk to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.
Avoid using ibuprofen with other NSAIDs, as it increases the risk of side effects.
Oxycodone:
Start with a low dose and gradually increase under the supervision of a doctor.
Use oxycodone on a regular schedule rather than an as-needed basis to minimize the risk of dependency.
Monitor for side effects like drowsiness, dizziness, and constipation. Increase fluid and fiber intake to reduce the risk of constipation.
General recommendations:

Keep a medication diary to track side effects and identify any patterns.
Engage in regular communication with the healthcare team to discuss side effects and adjust the medication plan as needed.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting adequate sleep to support overall health.
Remember to consult a healthcare professional before making any changes to a medication regimen.
